Well, after using the trailer a couple times, I became a little concerned that the surge from the old spring-based hitch might become a problem as the weight climbed (eg, 20-40lbs of rabbit litter).  So I decided to try and build a hinged universal joint that would do the job.  You can see what I can up with below:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Trailer_Hitch_Top --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Trailer_Hitch_Top" --data="Trailer_Hitch_Top" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}
{% lightbox /assets/images/Trailer_Hitch_Side --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Trailer_Hitch_Side" --data="Trailer_Hitch_Side" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

I settled on shelf brackets (which are nice and rigid) mounted to a piece of electrical box cover for the hinge on the bike, and a pair of straightened brackets for the trailer arm hinge.  The result seems to work fairly well, demonstrating noticably less surge than the previous design.  You can read a bit more about it on the [Bicycle Trailer](../projects/Bicycle_Trailer.md) page.
