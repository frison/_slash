Finally **finally**, winter has arrived.  Sure, we've had cold weather, but without snow, it just ain't the same.  Then, in the last 24 hours, we get something like 10 to 14 centimeters!

Of course, that much snow certainly screws up the city infrastructure for a while, and so, given that the buses were running around 30 minutes late, Lenore and I decided to declare and Snow Day and "work" from home. :)  'course, we did this with the expectation that many of our other co-workers would forgo the commute and do the same.

Well, we were wrong.  Apparently we work with people who are far more dedicated to their jobs than I realized.  Or they love sitting in traffic for hours just to say they did.  Regardless, Team TK ended up being the only ones absent from work.  Thanks a lot, guys!
