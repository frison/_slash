Given that I'm part of the Men Who Knit webring, it seemed like a good idea to write an entry about, you know... knitting.

First off, I gotta thank Lenore for a lovely christmas present.  I'd on occasion eyed the [Denise Interchangeable Knitting Needles](http://www.knitdenise.com/).  This set, which comes in a nice, folding case (with the name Denise stamped on the front in gold embossing... did I mention I really dislike the name 'Denise'?  And gold embossing?), comes with a large assortment of needle tips (ranging from 5 to 15US) and cables ranging from 5" to 19".  In addition, the kit comes with joiners, so you can join cables together for larger pieces, as well as attachable stitch holders (of which I've already lost one), so you can transform a cable into a flexible straight needle or a stitch holder.

The result is an incredibly compact, yet very flexible kit, which is particularly handy if you tend to knit on the go, as I do.  And at ~$50 bucks, the kit is a **huge** bargain, as it easily replaces a very large needle collection.  Highly recommended!

On the project front, the baby blanket continues unabated.  All the components are finished and blocked, so all that remains is to sew it together.  Yeah... that's all.  I just have to assemble a blanket from the ~30 parts I've made.  Oh, and did I mention I've misplaced my tapestry needles?

Additionally, in my spare cycles, I completed a new toque for myself from some very cool, chunky yard made from part lambs wool... let me tell you, this sucker is **warm**.  And it's actually long enough to cover my ears!  And with that done, I'm working on another [Yellow Goofy Toque](../projects/Yellow_Goofy_Toque.md) for Lenore, though this time slightly larger and in the same yarn I used to make [Lenores Mittens](../projects/Lenores_Mittens.md) and [Lenores Scarf](../projects/Lenores_Scarf.md).

See?  I knit.  I'm just too busy to write about it. :)
