As anyone who's seen our house knows, our master bedroom was... well... a bit of a slum.  Okay, not living-in-a-box slum, but still, not all that impressive given how nice our house is.  Well all that has finally changed!  Our new bedroom set has finally arrived!

It was a pretty damn close call, though... the armoire barely made it up our stairs, and the moving guys needed Devin's and my help to do it.  Heck, if we didn't have the 9' ceilings or the stub wall beside the staircase, we would have been totally hosed.  But, lucky us, it all worked out!  So we now have a brand new bed, armoire, mule chest, and two nightstands, all made of solid [Alder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder).
