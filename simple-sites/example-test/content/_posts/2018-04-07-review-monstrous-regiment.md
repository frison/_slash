In a few words, Terry Pratchett shows us why fiction and satire are so vital and powerful.

Next to Night Watch and Small Gods, Monstrous Regiment is now one of my favourite Discworld novels. Tackling issues of gender equality, the insanity of war, and the dangers of blind nationalism, here Pratchett is, in my opinion, at his more powerful and his most poignant.

Powerful, because his message is so clear and lucid without feeling too on-the-nose. Poignant because, through it all, he realizes that the characters are what matter most.

The great power in Pratchett's characters is not in any one, remarkable act of bravery or heroism. Rather, he makes us care for these fictional people by showing us their small acts of kindness and nobility. By the end, we desperately want these people to succeed and be rewarded for that success because, above all, we like them.

In the field of science fiction and fantasy, it's not unusual for authors to get so wrapped up in their clever concept that they forget that, at least for this reader, the characters are what truly matter. What makes Pratchett so remarkable is that he somehow manages to achieve both.
