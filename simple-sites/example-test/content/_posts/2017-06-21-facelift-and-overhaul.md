If it wasn't obvious, I haven't been maintaining this place... well... at all, really.  But, it doesn't seem unreasonable to slowly bring it back to life for the few people who land here by, let's face it, complete accident.

That means an upgrade to [Oddmuse](https://oddmuse.org/) for starters, and that's breaking stuff, like, all over the place.

But, such is the chaos of a home in construction.  You have been warned!
