Well, it had to happen eventually.  For the first time ever, in the history of my pie baking experience, I had a complete, utter, total, truly **spectacular** pie failure.  Well, they say a picture says a thousand words:

Frankly, I'm at a loss for words.  Obviously, I pulled it out well before it was "done".  But it's clear the crust simply **melted** in the oven... honestly, I've never seen anything like it.

Now I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong, and while it's very possible I just measured the fat wrong, I'm actually wondering if it was how I decided to use the food processor this time 'round.  In the past, I've just used it to cut the fat into the dough, and it's worked quite well for that purpose.  But this time, I decided to add the water to the dough and bring it together in the processor, as well.  As a result, my only guess is that the result was the fat getting over-processed into the dough

But the real killer is I spent, literally, two or three hours last night preparing dough, and then another hour and a half peeling and slicing apples today, and that doesn't count all the rolling effort and so forth.  Am I choked?  Yeah... just a little.  And I'll be damned if I'm gonna bake another pie any time soon...
