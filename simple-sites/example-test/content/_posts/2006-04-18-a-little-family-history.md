So we went to visit my Granda Kosinski on the Easter weekend... first time in, like, 5 months, much to my chagrin.  Anyway, she lives down in Camrose, so we did the drive down there and visited for a couple hours and did the usual... talked talked talked.  Well, during the course of discussions, we some how landed on the topic of books, and I discovered a rather interesting little factoid:  apparently my great-grandma's, and hence also my grandma's, favourite book was/is "The Count of Monte Cristo"!  Heck, my grandma owns two copies of the book, and while we were chatting about it, proceeded to describe some of the major plot points, something I can barely do with any book I've read.  Now, this in and of itself is interesting, particularly since my great-grandma, when first introduced to the book, couldn't actually read, and so only knew it because she heard other people reading it out loud.  But the other thing that makes this all rather ironic, at least to me, is that TCMC is one of a small handful of books that I consciously chose not to finish (one of the others being "The Plague", by Albert Camus, but I think I can hardly be blamed for that one).

Anyway, I think I can do nothing but make another attempt at the book, so back into the queue it goes.  Which means I should get to it sometime... next year, maybe.
