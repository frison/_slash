After adding a Windows VM to the mix, to support the few things I need to do with that OS, I've found I'm actually seriously considering completely wiping Windows from this laptop and doing a single boot Ubuntu environment!

This is a genuinely surprising development.  I never expected Ubuntu to work so darn well on this machine, but it's pretty close to flawless.  Heck, I recently had this machine plugged into my work corporate network, and the thing auto-discovered and set up the network printers without any direct intervention from me.

Mind == blown.

Meanwhile, Windows 10 in Virtualbox, while not the most high-performance environment in the world, is a perfectly suitable environment for Skype, Webex, Outlook, and any other little Windows dependencies I might encounter.

Honestly, I feel like after many years in the wilderness, I'm coming home once again.  Linux is just a far more familiar, comfortable environment for me.  I didn't realize how much I missed it!
