So much [Knitting](../projects/Knitting_Projects.md), so little time.  I'm currently working on a project for a friend of mine (I'd worry about you reading this, Massie, but... I doubt anyone is reading this :):  a [Dr. Who Scarf](../projects/Dr._Who_Scarf.md).  I used to have a decent picture of the original, but it's misplaced somewhere, and the best I could find is this:

![Original Dr. Who Scarf](/assets/images/Original_Dr._Who_Scarf)

It's freakin' huge... probably about 10-11 feet when finished, many colours, and simply a whole heck of a lot of work.  Fortunately, it's almost done.  Almost.  Probably another foot to go, and then all the weaving-in-of-ends (damn I hate that part).  Once it's done I'll put up a couple pictures.

On a more [Gardening](Gardening.md)-related note, Lenore and I decided to plant apple trees!  'course, we bought them over a week and a half ago, and only now, with our landscaping **finally** completed, have I been able to get them in the ground.  One is a Norland and one is a Battleford, with the Battleford going in the front yard and the Norland in the back.  Both are quite small right now (I'll take some pictures soon), around 2 feet tall, so we won't be getting a yield for a couple years.  But, in the meantime, here's something to [look forward to](http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/farnorth/msg0801121012864.html).
