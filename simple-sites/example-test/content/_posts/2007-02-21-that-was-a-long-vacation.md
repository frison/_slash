I didn't think I'd like Disney World.  The kids.  The strollers.  The cranky parents.  The constant barrage of Disney-branded products.  And that damned Mickey head **everywhere**!  Really, it sounds like my worst nightmare.

But it wasn't that bad.  Okay, sure, it was cheesy, and there really was a constant barrage of Disney-branded products.  It was crowded, expensive, and the weather sucked.  But oddly, I had a pretty decent time.  We spent our first day in Animal Kingdom, which is basically a large zoo.  Day two was dedicated to Magic Kingdom, which is the Disneyland replica.  And day three found us in Epcot.  Yes, we chose to forgo MGM, since neither of us cares that much about rollercoasters or movie trivia.

I can't say I can really pick a favourite among the parks.  I enjoy zoos (at least ones that have decent animal enclosures and work hard on conservation efforts and so forth), and they had some decent attractions.  The Magic Kingdom had quite a few good attractions, and I particularly enjoyed the Haunted Mansion (some of the effects there are quite impressions) and Space Mountain.  Of course, the Dream Fastpasses we won, which allowed us to hit each FP-enabled ride once whenever we wanted, were pretty darn nice as well.  And Epcot has some fantastic simulators (the space simulator was particularly impressive), and a ridiculous fireworks show at the end of the evening.

So, yeah, overall, good experience.

After that, we visited Lenore's friend Michelle and her family in Alabama, which included a visit to the Huntsville Space and Rocketry center, which is run by NASA.  That was very cool, and gave me a chance to see the Pathfinder shuttle, a real Saturn V rocket, as well as a vertically standing replica (the Saturn V will actually collapse under it's own weight if it's stood vertically without being fueled), and a ton of other artifacts, including a capsule from one of the Apollo missions.  **Very** cool stuff.  And, as a bonus, one of Michelle's friends, a guy by the name of Andre, joined us.  Andre works at NASA.  Andre was involved in the Cassini mission, and now finds himself working on the liquid stage for the Ares I rocket!

So, in the end, a good trip.  Exhausting, but good.
