So, when we went ahead with building our deck, I chose to rely on Roy to make sure it matched the building codes of Alberta.  Looking back, this was probably not the greatest idea, since, if I was at least semi-knowledgeable in these things, I could ask questions and verify things as we went along.

Well, my buddy Chris has begun working on his deck, and he decided to actually read up on a few things, and now I'm starting to wonder about a few things myself. The biggest concern I have is that our lower tier is set up on 2x6 joists with an 8' span between the two beams, and has a total depth of 12', which means a 24" cantilever on either end, give or take.  The problem is that, according to the building code, with 2x6 joists you can only have a 16" cantilever (actually, 15", or 2.5 times the width of the joists).  Whoops.  Additionally, according to a safety officer Chris talked to, as of July 2005, they're telling people to use 3 ply beams.  We used 2 ply.  Hopefully it's just a suggestion...

Consequently, I think we're just not going to apply for a permit any time soon. :)  You don't need one until you sell your house, which we don't plan to do for quite a while (if ever... getting our armoire out of our bedroom is, I suspect, nigh on impossible), and even then, the buyer can choose to purchase anyway and the previous owner may be subject to a fine.  And, I gotta say, at this point... I'm tempted to just wait it out and pay the fine.

**Update:**

Well, apparently Chris went and asked the Rona folks about their deck packages and conformance with building codes.  Turns out they knowingly sell deck packages which don't conform to our local building codes!  Specifically, they use 2x6 joists and 2-ply beams with a 24" cantilever.  How nice of them...
