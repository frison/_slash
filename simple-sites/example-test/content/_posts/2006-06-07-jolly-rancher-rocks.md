Anyone who knows me knows that I have a really nasty addiction to junk food.  I love the stuff.  You'd think I'd grow out of this, but I really don't.  It's not good.  Particularly for my ailing teeth.  I especially enjoy trying out new types of candy, and have had the pleasure of discovering some tasty new treats (Sour Skittles, Sour Patch Keys, Sour Twizzlers... hmm, I see a pattern forming...).  My latest experiment is a new Hershey product called Jolly Rancher Rocks:

Now, I've always been a fan of the Jolly Rancher flavours.  I remember back in the day when I first tried them out... so very tasty.  But I've always been the type to chew my rock candies, and the odd not-quite-brittle texture of the Jolly Rancher made it more likely that I would fracture a tooth rather than the candy itself.  Moreover, I often found that the standard rock candy was slightly larger than I prefer.

Hershey's new Jolly Rancher Rocks product seems to solve these problems.  The candy comes in a plastic container with a locking lid (a fairly high-quality container, I might add), and the candies themselves are small, fairly brittle rock candy spherules, around 5mm in diameter, in the standard Jolly Rancher flavours.  This repackaging of the standard Jolly Rancher rock candy works quite well, allowing one to mix and match flavours and enjoy as much or as little as one would like.  And the locking lid makes it easy to eat the candies a little at a time.

So, in the end, I give the new product a thumbs up.  In fact, given my choice, I think I'd favour the rocks over the standard rock candy format we're so familiar with.
