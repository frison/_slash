Rich, resident conspiracy theorist, was surprisingly respectable, his closely trimmed beard and precisely styled hair giving him the air of a moderately successful realtor. "Levitation, huh?" he said.

"Yeah, like I said on the phone, a full three inches!"  He could feel his friend leaning in.

"Two and a half," she corrected.

"I'm just rounding to the nearest #inch!"

As his feet left the floor Rich leaned back, his face #neutral. "I've seen better."
