So, I was browsing around on [Men Who Knit](http://www.menwhoknit.com), a community site for male knitters (yes, apparently there are enough of us that a dedicated website is warranted), when I came across a few posts that I absolutely **had** to share.  Someone came across a publication called "Brunswick Mostly Male" and posted some pics from patterns therein.  And trust me... the name fits:

* [Second](http://www.menwhoknit.com/node/694)
* [Third](http://www.menwhoknit.com/node/695)

I think the jumpsuit is my favourite.  I gotta **gets** me one of those!
