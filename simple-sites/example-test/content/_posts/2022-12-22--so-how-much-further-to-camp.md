"So, how much further to camp?" he asked as he gently removed his boot, his ankle already clearly swollen.

"About 10k," his friend replied, inspecting the ankle before wrapping it in a tensor #bandage. "Given it's all downhill, normally around two hours. But with this injury? My guess is at least four."

"So we'll be setting up in the dark. Great."

It was at that moment that they felt the first few drops of rain start to fall.
