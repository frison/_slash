Well, tonight was a nice night for observing.  Very clear, fairly
warm... good stuff!  I decided to go searching a little higher
in the sky and found myself in Sagitta and Vulpecula.  Initially,
I tried for M71, a dense globular in Sagitta.  But, for all the
searching I did, I simply couldn't find it!  And I'm positive I
looked in the right place.  Very strange, since it's only mag 7.0.

On a positive note, I found M27, aka, the Dumbbell Nebula tonight!
This is a bright, 8th magnitude planetary nebula located in
Vulpecula.  It showed itself as a faint smudge against a starry
background.  I can't say I really noticed the dumbbell shape. :)
Still, very cool... my first nebula!
