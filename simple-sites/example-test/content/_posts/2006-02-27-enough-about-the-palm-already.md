So I returned my Palm and got my cash back.  I was planning to get it replaced at the store, but unfortunately they didn't have any in stock, which is, apparently, the normal state of things (I've returned to FS and BB, since, and still no TXs in stock).  Given all this trouble, part of me is wondering if I should bother replacing it...

Unfortunately, just the day before my Palm died, I bought myself a car charge for the thing... a frickin' $50 car charger (I coulda swore the tag on the shelf said $29.99).  Moreover, like an ass, I threw out the packaging and receipt, meaning I can't return it.  So, I figure, trying another TX is probably worth $50.  OTOH, if I have trouble again, well... Palm can just kiss my lily white <bleep>.

On a completely unrelated note, as I sit here typing away, Seventh Heaven is on TV. Now, those who know me have heard this, but I really think it needs to be in writing:  I firmly believe that Seventh Heaven is, hands down, the worst television ever made, in the entire history of civilization.  I challenge anyone, anyone at all, to come up with a counter example.  Good luck!  You'll need it.
