So, first of all, Ubuntu on my Carbon continues to rock pretty hard.  I'm genuinely impressed!  To date, the only issues keeping me from going 100% Ubuntu all the time were work related:

* We use Skype for Business
* Webex on Linux basically sucks (at my company where we haven't had the web app enabled yet)
* Outlook Web App is fantastic... until you want to book a meeting, and then it basically sucks.
  * Oh, plus it does have some weird authoring glitches that are a bit of a PITA.

But for personal use, it's been a total champ!

Fortunately, I've also found the obvious solution to the above issues (and one I'm sure many others employ): a Windows VM.

In particular, Windows 10 + VirtualBox is a perfectly capable solution for the aforementioned issues.  Heck, even my Bluetooth headset and laptop camera work (in the case of the latter, it straight up works in vbox, and in the case of the former it looks like just another audio input/output device attached to the VM)!

And since the use cases are so modest, I can throw a measly 4GB of the total 16GB on this thing at Windows and everything runs pretty darn smoothly.

Not bad at all!

Oh, and also I decided to throw a little brutalism on this website for kicks.  Enjoy!
