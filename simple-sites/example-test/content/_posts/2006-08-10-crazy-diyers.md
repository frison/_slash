Okay, I thought I'd heard it all when I learned about [Sailboat Arcadia](http://sailboat.creatica.org/).  I mean, some guy building a boat in his backyard??  Well, I came across something equally hardcore today...

Tell me, have you heard of [David J. Gingery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingery)?  Yeah, neither had I.  Well, this crazy nutjob, who was, to quote Wikipedia, "an inventor, writer, and machinist", wrote a series of books on how to build machine tools.  Not too remarkable, right?  Well, what makes this so unbelievable is that he didn't do it by buying parts from hardware stores and so forth.  Oh no, that would be too easy.  Instead, he figured out how to build his own [Foundry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundry) in his back yard, capable of melting aluminum and zinc alloys.  Then, using [Green_sand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sand) molds, he casted the parts he needed and built his devices from scratch.

But it doesn't end there.  After figuring all this out, he wrote a series of [books](http://www.lindsaybks.com/dgjp/djgbk/series/index.html) which, in simple, clear language, describe how to build a metal working shop.  The first book covers the construction of a charcoal foundry, and the remaining volumes describe how to build various metal working equipment from recycled scrap metal, including, believe it or not, a lathe and a drill press.  And all this can be done without the need for power tools or other expensive gear.

Now, you're probably asking yourself, "does he really plan to build a metal working shop??"  In short, no. :)  After completing such a project, I honestly have no idea what I'd do with it.  But you must admit, it's pretty damned amazing.
