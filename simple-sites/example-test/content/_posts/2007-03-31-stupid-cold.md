So on Wednestday evening, Lenore and I came down with cold symptoms at virtually the exact same time... personally, I blame Lenore.  That, or the public transit system.  Nothing like a bus packed full of people who like to cough without covering their mouths to spread the germs.  Anyway, the end result is that we spent Thursday, Friday, and most of Saturday laid up.  It's been fun.  Real fun.

Anyway, to alleviate some boredom, I took Wednesday evening to pick up a couple new games for my DS (I actually **lost** a couple games at one point... but I'd rather not get into that right now. It's a bit of a sore spot), in order to pass the time.  Sure, I could watch TV, but there's only so much on the PVR to view.  Or I could read, though reading requires concentration, and concentration requires a clear head, which is frustrated greatly by a cold.  So, I figured, mindless entertainment, that's where it's at.

Well, what did I pick up?  The following:

1. Yoshi's Island DS
2. Mario Kart[^1]
3. Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time

Anyway, Yoshi's Island is a pretty straight-forward port of Yoshi's Island 2 for the SNES.  An excellent platformer.  I'll skip Mario Kart.  And then we have PiT, which is a Mario-themed RPG, and another excellent game.

But, what I **haven't** done is written much in the last few days.  I took Wednesday off for whatever reason.  Thursday and Friday I was too sick to even consider sitting down at the computer.  And today, I find myself struggling, trying to get back into the story I'm working on.  Which is an interesting lesson:  writing every day is important for honing one's skills.  But it's also very important when working on a longer piece, as one can easily lose momentum and fall out of the mood of the piece, or worse, one might lift one's head up and begin having doubts... maybe it really does suck.  Maybe it's just a stupid idea.  Blah blah blah.  It's definitely a challenge.

So, hopefully today or tomorrow, I can try and remedy the situation.  Step one, I think, is to read a little more Dickens.  He always seems to inspire me.

[^1]: This would be one of those games I *thought* I lost.  Until, that is, I discovered it in my DS. So if anyone's looking for a discount copy of Mario Kart DS, gimme a call...
