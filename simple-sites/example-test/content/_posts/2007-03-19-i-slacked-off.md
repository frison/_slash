It's not my fault.  My brother came to town, and I found my free time over the weekend suddenly evaporate.  See, Saturday was Dim Sum and Movie Day, and Sunday was Visit The Neglected Grandma Day.  Neither provided much opportunity to get some writing in.  So, alas, my current piece is hovering at ~7,200 words, and hasn't moved much since Friday (and I took Thursday as a break).

On the flip side, I think I'm almost done with this one, and while I really doubt it's anything worth reading, it will soon be my second completed piece of fiction, and hey, that ain't bad.  The biggest problem, at this stage, is the ending.  The concept was actually born out of the ending itself, and now that I'm about to get there... I'm not sure I like the ending anymore.  But, I've decided I'll just charge ahead and see how things turn out.  If I'm right and it sucks, I can always rip it out and try something different.  And if I'm wrong, well... that'd be great!

Meanwhile, I've been fiddling around with an idea that's been bouncing around in my brain for the last couple months.  It's more situational, so rather than worrying about building a story back from an interesting ending, I need to worry about coming up with an interesting ending to what I think is a compelling storyline.  I'm not as yet sure how I'll handle this, but maybe the answer is just to start writing and see where the concept takes me.
