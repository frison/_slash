Well, believe it or not, I achieved all of my necessary goals from yesterday.  The garden got staked out, the rhubarb made it into the ground (though slightly the worse for wear, I think...), and the composter is now assembled with a bed of twigs in the bottom, ready to accept it's first household waste!  Which doesn't sound nearly as awesome when I write it out like that...

Anyway, the rhubarb was probably the biggest challenge.  It was previously housed in an old tub that, I believe, was intended to be sunk into the ground and turned into a small pond (thanks, Mom... :).  As a result, I had to dig around the outside edge and, eventually, man-handle the thing out of the container, damaging the root ball in the process (which had completely filled the tub, much to my surprise).  Fortunately, this plant has already proved itself quite hardy (surviving an artificially induced drought last fall) so I hold out some hope that it will survive unscathed.

The only other tricky bit was deciding where to put the garden.  The tree was, thanks to me, unfortunately placed last fall, due to a lack of complete understanding regarding the dimensions of our yard.  As a result, I had to take  Lenore's suggestion and extend the garden in behind the tree, in order to use up that dead space... obviously shade-loving plants will need to grow there.  You can see the layout in this photo:

In total, the back section is 4'x5', and the front is 6'x19', for a total of 134 square feet (I think... :).  My goal was to make it possible to divide it up into 2 or 4 square foot sections, rather than doing long rows.  We'll see how that works out.
