This is a bit of a belated entry, but hey... better belated than never, eh?  Well, I suppose that depends on the content of the entry...

Anyway, last weekend I decided to ignore the fact that it's so late in the season and planted a garden anyway!  After which we had near-monsoon weather, but... so it goes... hopefully my seeds don't drown.  The end result is depicted below:

As you can see, I've planted a few crops:

1. Romaine Lettuce
2. Corn
3. Parsley
4. Peas
5. Dill
6. Carrots

The idea was that, hopefully, these crops all can be started late (with the exception of the corn... that's mostly an experiment).  So, in three months, hopefully we'll have some fresh veggies for the bunnies!  Oh, and a few carrots and peas for us.
