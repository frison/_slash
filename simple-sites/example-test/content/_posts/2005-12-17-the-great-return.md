Ahh Hawaii.  Damn, I can't believe I'm back in cold, cold Canada.  What a beautiful place.  And the marathon: incredible.  But I'll write about that later.  Meanwhile, here's a couple panoramas from the trip:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-0c3bec10436d27b1 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-0c3bec10436d27b1" --data="Image-0c3bec10436d27b1" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}
{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-44bcc641a32e290a --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-44bcc641a32e290a" --data="Image-44bcc641a32e290a" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

Did I mention how incredibly awesome [Autostitch](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/autostitch/autostitch.html) is?  Because if you want to create panoramas of your own, and you have access to a Windows box, it must be the most powerful, simple-to-use panorama tool I've ever used.  **Very** cool.
