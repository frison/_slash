Well, I finally have some photos of my latest knitting projects uploaded.  First, we have [Michelles Scarf](Michelles_Scarf.md), which was actually completed and shipped off months ago, but only now have I gotten to posting a photo:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-5a3c3d9be6f5a513 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-5a3c3d9be6f5a513" --data="Image-5a3c3d9be6f5a513" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

This is, without question, my favorite piece.  The cable pattern is reversible, which is very cool, and the yarn Lenore helped pick out looks really fantastic in pattern (it's got a glossy, satin-ey finish... very nice, given it's just off-the-shelf stuff from Michael's).  It was also a heck of a lot of fun to put together (I really love cabling).

Secondly, we have [Abigails Baby Blanket](Abigails_Baby_Blanket.md), which I just recently completed.  It's a pretty simple pattern, just a nice shell-and-cable deal, but it looks great in the green yarn Lenore, again, helped pick out:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-20c922f134ca645d --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-20c922f134ca645d" --data="Image-20c922f134ca645d" --img-style="max-width:100;" %} {% lightbox /assets/images/Image-8bb168d6c3e19cd7 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-8bb168d6c3e19cd7" --data="Image-8bb168d6c3e19cd7" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

'course, with all the work on [NetHackDS](NetHackDS.md), I've had little time to pick up the needles lately.  Which is unfortunate, as I really need to begin working on a project for our now-quite-pregnant receptionist.  Oh well, I'm sure it'll be done... you know... a couple months after the baby is born.  Ish.
