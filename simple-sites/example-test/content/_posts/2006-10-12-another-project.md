Okay, this one's a little different, though.  I swear.  It costs a **lot** more than my previous projects...

So what is it?  Well, for many months now, I've talked on and off about building a DIY PVR setup.  Usually this starts off with me complaining about the timeslots for [The Daily Show](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml) and [The Colbert Report](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml), and quickly turns into a discussion of how awesome a PVR would be for timeshifting my favorite shows, listening to all the music I've transferred onto my computer, and watching all the content I've downlo... err... ahem.  Anyway, as a result, I've often thought about:

1. Buying and modding an XBox,
2. Building a MythTV-based system, or
3. Buying a Shaw PVR.

But it wasn't until I got my pay adjustment, and the attendant backpay (all the way back to last **december**!) that it became a practical possibility.  The problem is, now flush with cash, I think I've gone a little overboard.

It all started with plans to build a simple MythTV-based PVR with a mini-itx board of some kind, mounted in a little case.  It didn't take long before this ballooned into a full frontend/backend networked multimedia infrastructure project, with all it's associated costs.  But you know what?  I don't care, damnit! :)

Anyway, I've started some new pages to cover my [MythTV](../projects/MythTV.md) project.  There you can read about my motivations, details about MythTV, and the hardware I'm using.  As for the current status, the gear has all been ordered and should arrive in the next few weeks, at which point, the fun begins!  Meanwhile, I'll need to string some cat5e between my living room and where the backend will live, so that should keep me busy.

And just to give you a little taste, here is a shot of the case I'm going to use for the [Living Room Frontend](../projects/Living_Room_Frontend.md):
