Well, this entry is being made retroactively. :) I found my first
deep-sky object!  NGC 6633 is a nice open cluster south of Altair.
It took me <B>forever</B> to find it!  'course, that's mostly
because I spent so much time verifying the stars I was using for
guides (specifically, Altair :).

Anyway, NGC 6633 is quite a nice open cluster.  Of course, in the
city, it looks a little sparse, as many of its lower magnitude stars
are too dim to see.  However, it's still quite pretty, and
definitely makes a good first target, as it's fairly bright (mag 4.8)
and surrounded by a number of bright stars which make excellent
guide stars.  Quite rewarding! :)
