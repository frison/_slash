Dark and haunting is probably the best way to describe this volume. The story revolves around a number of agents of the dreamworld who, in Morpheus' absence, have decided to have a little fun of their own. You can start to see the mythos really start to flesh outself out in this storyline, though the ending seemed to come a bit easily...
