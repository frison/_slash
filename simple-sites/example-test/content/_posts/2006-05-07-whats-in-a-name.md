Hmm, apparently I'm in the mood for clich&eacute;s... anyway, for those few (very few) readers I have, you might notice the name change for this site.  Well, when I first created this site, it's main purpose was to act as a place for me to host information about my various projects.  As a result, I just picked the first lame-ass name that came to mind.  But, as my site has grown, I quickly realized that a name change was inevitable.  And that day has finally come.

But why "The 'B' Ark"?  Well, my fellow Douglas Adams fans will recognize the name of that fateful ship launched from Golgafrincham, packed with its telephone sanitizers, marketing personelle, and other "undesirables", which ultimately crashed on Earth and populated the planet with our forebearers.  Thus, the name is a little nod to one of my very favourite authors (who died far too soon).  It also seems appropriate that, had bloggers existed at the time Hitchhiker's was written, they probably would have been included on the "B" Ark.  And of course it seems hardly a coincidence that "B" is for blogger **and** "B" is for Brett!  So multilayered...
