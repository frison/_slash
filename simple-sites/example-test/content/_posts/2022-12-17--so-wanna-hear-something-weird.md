"So wanna hear something weird?" he said, taking off his jacket. "I just ran into #JohnMastodon on the way into Walmart. He was standing there greeting people and handing out cupcakes."

His wife looked up from her crossword. "No kidding!" she said. "I heard he was downtown yesterday giving out free hugs. Apparently he emits the subtle odor of vanilla and clove."

He nodded. "Yeah, I heard the same thing. Truly we don't deserve him."
