So, I finally get my pictures up, and not even a week later, my Palm dies.  Yes, dies.  After attempting to power the damn thing on, it spontaneously reset.  Now, I'll admit, this isn't the first time this has happened (stability has been... okay.  Not what I expected, but I'm guessing about average), so I  took it in stride and waited for it to boot back up.  But, instead of booting... it just hung at the Palm Powered logo. :/

Well, the next natural step was to perform a hard reset, which should reformat the NVFS memory and restore it to it's factory defaults (I've done this once already, for other reasons, so it wasn't an unusual procedure to me).  Things seemed to work... it asked me to confirm the hard reset, to which I said 'yes', and then... it hung at the Palm logo again.  Piece of shit.

Of course, my next move was to search Google and see if there was a solution.  Thus, I ran across this [forum discussion](http://www.1src.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-99852.html) where a person described the exact same symptoms.  The consensus?  Get the unit returned.  ASAP.  And don't return it to Palm, if possible, lest you be stuck with a refurbished unit.

So there you have it, my first Palm adventure.  It was going so well.  I'm just glad I didn't become deeply reliant on it before this all happened.

Anyway, the next step is to head to Future Shop and see if I can get this damned thing replaced with a new unit (shouldn't be a problem, but we'll see).  OTOH, if they attempt to get me to return it to Palm, I may just tell 'em to fuck off and give me my money back.
