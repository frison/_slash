For those unaware, a couple months back I decided to get in on the [OLPC](http://www.laptop.org) G1G1 program, which allowed we priviledged members of the first world two buy two XO units, one which would go to a school somewhere in the developing world, and one that we could keep.  The goal of the program was to spur interest in their work while encouraging donations, and let me tell ya, it sure worked on me!  As it also did for two of my co-worker. :)

Anyway, I'm happy to report that a couple days ago, my XO arrived!  And it's a fine thing to behold.  Compact and cleverly designed, these tiny, kid-focused, ruggedized laptops are a marvel of technology.  Darn cute, too.

Anyway, there's a ton of other pictures and material one these little things, so rather than going on and on about what makes them so cool, I'll just post a photo and be done with it:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-a185fdaf21f3ceca --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-a185fdaf21f3ceca" --data="Image-a185fdaf21f3ceca" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

BTW, did I mention I typed this up on the XO?  Well, aside from the photo upload, which apparently doesn't work in the XO browser.
