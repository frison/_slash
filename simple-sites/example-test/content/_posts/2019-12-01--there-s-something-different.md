> There’s something different about a nap on the couch next to your loved ones while a screen is on, as opposed to in silence alone in bed. I think it feels festive, somehow. It’s that post-holiday-meal vibe. It’s luxurious and drowsy and it was so pleasant that I think I might try to do it more often.

Ahh, so true!  When I was a kid I fondly remember Sunday afternoons when a re-run of Star Trek would be on the TV while my dad napped on the couch.  It's now become one of my favorite things to do on the weekend: an episode of TOS playing as I snooze on the couch while my wife reads beside me.
