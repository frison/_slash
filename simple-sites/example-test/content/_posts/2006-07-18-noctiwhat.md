You may recall that back in [Blog-2006-06-24](Blog-2006-06-24.md), I wrote about ghostly blue clouds that I observed in the northern sky at the end of my observing session.  Well, as it turns out, I was fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of a type of cloud known as a [Noctilucent_cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud).  These extremely high altitude clouds are typically too faint to be seen.  However, when illuminated from below by a deeply set sun, they are visible as the beautiful blue colour I observed.

So, how did I figure this out?  Well, I happen to read the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/), and [Today's Feature Image](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap060718.html) just happened to be of noctilucent clouds.
