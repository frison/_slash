Okay, not really *globe*trotting, but recently Lenore and I decided to take advantage of a deal that Air Canada has going on right now.  The gist?  For the months of January and February, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, we have unlimited flights to select Canadian and US cities!  And the cost?  A mere $800 per person.  Virtual peanuts!  And as a bonus, we've talked to our manager, and he okayed us to bank time so that we can take Mondays off without burning holidays, which means we can take some little weekend trips (or the odd big one)!

Of course, you may be asking yourself, where on earth will we go?  Well, as it turns out, we have a couple of plans.  The first trip we came up with will commence on the 13th of February, and will have us flying to Orlando, Florida, with the goal of spending three days at Walt Disney World!  Should be good fun.  The second leg of the trip will take us to Atlanta for another three days, where we'll be visiting one of Lenore's Intarweb friends.  Of course, to get there, we have to fly from Orlando to Toronto, then from Toronto to Atlanta.  You can probably guess why:  Air Canada doesn't fly between US cities.  But, so it goes... at least I'll have plenty of time to read, knit, etc, etc.

Anyway, that trip alone makes the passes worth it.  But today Lenore suggested another trip for the weekend of January 13th (I think):  We're gonna go back to NYC!   Now, granted, we've already been there a few times, but there's always a ton of things to see and do there.  And we can set up the flights such that we arrive early Saturday morning, and come back Tuesday afternoon, which makes for a nice little trip with nearly three full days in the city.  As for things to do,  we've already bought tickets to the Museum of Natural History, which we've never been to, and should be absolutely fantastic, and there's always Broadways shows, the library, and I'm sure many many other things.

As for other trips, who knows.  Lenore has been talking about heading back to Regina to visit her mom.  And there's always Ottawa, Vancouver, Las Vegas, and who knows what else.  'course, there's only so many weekends left, so it'll be tough prioritizing, but I'm sure we'll be able to come up with something.
