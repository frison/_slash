It never ends.  First it's the damn beam being off.  Then it's all these building code issues.  Now, after discussions with Chris, who was told by a Rona employeee that the builder almost certainly **didn't** bolt his ledger to the house, and instead only nailed it, I've quickly realized that my own ledger board is only nailed to the house!  ARGH!

So now what?  You guessed it... I have to remove the deck boards closest to the house, drill holes and install lag screws or bolts, all of which is going to be that much more difficult because the damn joists and decking are in place.  And who knows if they installed flashing (or something equivalent to stave off water).  I sure hope they did, 'cuz it's too late now...

**Update:**

Well, I've confirmed that there is top flashing on the ledger board, there's just no back flashing.  Hopefully that's sufficient in these parts.

Incidentally, it **looks** like this is a job I can safely do now.  From what I can tell, the goal is to drill holes through the ledger board and into the house band board (the outside-most board that makes up the flooring).  Then,  drive through carriage bolts and secure with washers and nuts.

Actually, scratch that, I'm just going to use Lag Screws... less work than bolts, and sufficiently strong for my purposes.
