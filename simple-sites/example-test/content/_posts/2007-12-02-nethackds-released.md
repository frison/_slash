Yup, I finally got it to a state where I think it's done, and it now has it's own [home page](../projects/NetHackDS.md).  Sleep mode works.  Key config is implemented.  And text continues to be clipped.  Of course, there's plenty of bugs (I just spotted some weird behaviour in the message window), but I consider it "good enough" for public consumption.
