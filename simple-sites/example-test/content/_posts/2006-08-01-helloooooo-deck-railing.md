Alright alright, I finally have pictures of the new railing up.  Keep in mind, though, that there's still work to be done.  First, there's a small rail that I need to install on the upper tier near the window well.  Second, I need to install **something** in front of the window well on the lower tier (probably a railing, maybe a bench or something).  Third, the stair to the ground still needs to be built.  However, much of that will probably be put off for a week or two... I really need a break.

So, here we go:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-459c1fc667d051cf --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-459c1fc667d051cf" --data="Image-459c1fc667d051cf" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}
{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-3d09c3fd8c24f6f7 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-3d09c3fd8c24f6f7" --data="Image-3d09c3fd8c24f6f7" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}
{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-6185e3d34176a16c --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-6185e3d34176a16c" --data="Image-6185e3d34176a16c" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}
{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-7433c551bdf3b8a4 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-7433c551bdf3b8a4" --data="Image-7433c551bdf3b8a4" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

As you can see, I've got the railing and the stair between the two levels completed.  Looks pretty nice, if you ask me. ;)
