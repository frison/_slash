That's right... things have started arriving!  In particular, most of my NCIX-ordered items arrived, which allowed me to build my [MythTV Backend](../projects/MythTV_Backend.md)
and begin the software installation process.  I've now got Fedora Core 5 installed and a bunch of services configured (though, without the [Living Room Frontend](../projects/Living_Room_Frontend.md) ready, I can only get so much done).

Speaking of the frontend, the case has arrived!  So, of course, I had to take a picture:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Antec_Fusion_Case --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Antec_Fusion_Case" --data="Antec_Fusion_Case" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

It's bigger than I'd imagined, for some reason... about the size of a stereo receiver, and weighing in at a whopping 17lbs!  Of course, this is, in part, because of the steel used in most of it's construction.  But, I gotta say... it's pretty awesome. :)  And it'll fit **perfectly** in the TV stand.

Anyway, the EPIA board will likely arrive tomorrow (they apparently tried to deliver today, but I owe them money, presumably duty), and that only leaves the remaining NCIX items (which got shipped today) and the IR blaster/receiver, which are in the mail as I type this.  At which point the fun will **really** begin!
