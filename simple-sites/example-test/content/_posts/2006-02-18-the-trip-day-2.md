Apparently it was cold enough today for water to freeze in the ponds down around Granville Island, hence the ducks appearing to walk on water.

Anyway, we spent the afternoon wandering around the island, generally wasting time (woo woo, more shopping!), giving me further opportunity to fiddle about with my PDA and invade more WAPs (allowing me to start this entry).

Speaking of which, the PDA is generally working out well.  I've had some odd stability issues here and there (eg, Pocket Tunes now freezes up whenever I play anything, hence me switching to AeroPlayer), but I expected that, to some degree.  Other than that, it's been good.  And, if anything, it's provided plenty of distraction (not to mention a useful blogging tool).
