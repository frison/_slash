So, I've been an owner of a Nintendo DS since shortly after the device launched.  I picked it up originally because I planned to hack code for it... the idea of a cheap device with a touch screen and wireless really sparked my imagination.  But, thanks in part to the original launch game, Super Mario 64 DS, which was just so much damned fun, I've found myself actually playing games on the thing.

So, why would I advise you not to buy a DS?  Simple!  Because, if you're anything like me, you won't be able to resist the desire buy new games.  Since I picked up my DS, I've bought:

1. Super Mario 64 DS
2. Warioware: Touched
3. Advanced Wars DS
4. Meteos
5. Mariokart DS

And now, Tetris DS.  And I don't play my DS that much!  Incidentally, of that list, Touched is probably the main one I regret, followed by Meteos.  Touched just doesn't have much depth (I finished it pretty fast, and there's little replay value) and Meteos, while fun, hasn't captured my imagination.  It's also a bit confusing. :)

Anyway on to Tetris DS.  I gotta say, if you're a casual gamer, and in particular, a casual gamer who grew up during the 8-bit console era, this game is, IMHO, a must-have.  As a Tetris rendition, it's pretty damned good, and reasonably faithful to the gameplay we all remember.  About the only thing that bothers me is the inheritance of the infinite spin "feature" from Tetris Worlds, where you can continually spin a piece and move it around, even though it's landed on the tableau. 

In addition to the standard modes, the game also provides a variety of puzzle modes, versus modes, and a rather odd Catch mode.  Of the new modes, I gotta say Push mode is the coolest.  It's basically a Tetris tug-of-war, and brings about some interesting new game mechanics.  This mode can be played against the CPU, where the difficulty can be tuned from fairly easy to frustratingly difficult, or against people head-to-head or over the Internet.

Speaking of which, the head-to-head modes are very well executed.  In a local Wi-Fi enabled game, you can have up to 10 players playing using a single cart, with various options available to adjust gameplay.  Of course, you can also play online against people on Nintendo's network.  Unfortunately, the gameplay options are more limited, here:  2-player in Standard or Push mode, or 4 players in Standard mode.  Still, online play is very well polished, as with Mario Kart DS.

But the best part for a retrogamer like myself has gotta be the soundtrack and visual themes for the game.  For example, in Standard mode, you'll recognize the music as remixes from Super Mario 1, 3, Link, and Metroid.  Moreover, on the top screen, a demo of the game in question is played, and as you approach the next Tetris level, the character progresses through the game level (eg, world 1-1 of Super Mario Bros.).  Quite clever!  The other modes are themed differently.  For example, Catch mode is based on Metroid and Push mode has a Donkey Kong theme.

Of course, if one isn't a retrogamer, or (god forbid) you're too old to remember the good ol' 8-bit days, you might find this all quite annoying.  But I love it!

So, in summary, I'd give this new Tetris rendition an 8.  I just hope Nintendo could stop releasing such good games at reasonable prices, because, apparently, I'm unable to control myself...
