As I mentioned in my previous post, I still needed to build a box for my trailer.  Well, how better to spend my holiday monday than to do just that?  Below you can see the fruits of my labour:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Bike_with_Trailer_Box --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Bike_with_Trailer_Box" --data="Bike_with_Trailer_Box" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

And, of course, a close up:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Trailer_Box --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Trailer_Box" --data="Trailer_Box" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

As you can see, I built it from some exterior grade plywood and 2x2's.  And before you ask, yes, it's heavy.  Probably 20lbs, if I had to guess.  But it seems pretty solid, and should do the job nicely.  It's also quite roomy (40x20x16 inches, give or take), which means I can haul around even more junk!

Interestingly, while the wood was fairly inexpensive ($13 for the sheet of plywood, plus about $6 for the 2x2s), it was the fasteners which ended up being surprisingly expensive.  Heck, the wing nuts which are used to fasten the box to the trailer frame were a buck a piece!  But, such is life, and at least my project is complete!  Now, to find things to move...

Update:  I've summarized the project in a separate page entitled [Bicycle Trailer](../projects/Bicycle_Trailer.md).  Catchy, eh?
