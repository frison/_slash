Well, we've finally started moving on the deck front!  I went to Cedar Village this morning, the shop owned by our unbelievably generous family friend Roy Crosty, and did a little bit of deck planning.  I'm incredibly excited, as the end product looks absolutely fantastic:

As you can see, we're planning a two-tier deck.  This allows us to build a full-width deck while still preserving the basement window for an additional bedroom.  And for those we haven't told, it's going to be built from **cedar**!  So.  Sweet.  Not to mention fragrant!  Anyway, the materials have been ordered, so now we're awaiting delivery, which will likely occur some time in the middle of next week.  Once that's done, it's deck-buildin' time!

Of course, one can't build a deck without some tools, so we headed to Rona and picked up a couple items, specifically:

* 12A 7 1/4" circular saw
* 18V cordless drill
* Level and other random bits

And all for just over $100!  Yay for clearance items, and me being not terribly picky about my tools!  I figure, in the long run, should they prove insufficient, I can always upgrade later.

Unsurprisingly, though, I'm now itching to play with my new tools!  So, tomorrow I'll probably scavange some wood from various scrap piles nearby and build me a couple saw horses.  Once that's done, I might even attempt to move up to a set of shelves (for the new tools ;)!
