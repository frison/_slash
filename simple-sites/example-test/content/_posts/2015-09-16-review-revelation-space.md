Poor characterization and even poorer dialogue (honestly, don't give me the names of the characters and by their dialogue I probably wouldn't be able to tell them apart), uneven pacing, gimmicky writing (e.g., frequently creating artificial tension by withholding information from the reader for no good reason)... and a brilliant concept.

I have a like/detest relationship with this book. I nearly didn't finish it, but once the plotlines converge and we start rushing to the end, it becomes compelling enough to plow through.

But only barely.
