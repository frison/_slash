So my sis, wife and I went to [Thank You For Smoking](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/) last night.  Definitely a movie worth seeing.  The movie follows the trials and tribulations of a tobacco lobbiest, and is entertaining, scathing, and more than a bit surprising.

Now, when I originally heard about this movie, I made the (natural, I think) assumption that it was going to be a scathing commentary on the tobacco industry.  And it was definitely that.  But it exceeded my expectations in that it also poked fun at the government, embodied by a rabid anti-tobacco senator from Wisconsin played by the always excellent [William H. Macy](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000513/), and the media, represented by an ambitious reporter portrayed by none other than [Katie Holmes](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005017/).

And the ultimate message of the movie surprised me even more.  Rather than focusing on the evils of smoking, or the tobacco industry, it took the higher ground, focusing on the issue of personal choice.  Through the actions of the ridiculous senator, and the words of Nick Naylor, our "morally flexible" anti-hero portrayed by a surprising [Aaron Eckhart](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001173/) (yes, of [The Core](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298814/) fame), the movie really speaks out against an apathetic public who is unwilling, or perhaps no longer capable of thinking for themselves.  It implores people to inform themselves and to make their own decisions, and to guide their own children to do the same, rather than relying on the government or the media to do it for them.  A message I think is long overdue.

But what surprised me the most is, in the end, I found myself rooting for Nick Naylor.  For some reason, I just can't help cheering for the underdog, even if he is representing the tobacco industry...

And on a totally unrelated note, I finally updated my list of [Knitting Projects](../projects/Knitting_Projects.md).  I think it's relatively complete, now...
