Well, tonight was both fun and disappointing.  First, the fun part,
I tracked down a fairly easy-to-spot open cluster in Ophiuchus
called IC 4665.  IC 4665 is a very bright (4.5 mag), large, sparse
open cluster, with many brighter stars.  Compared to NGC 6633, 
IC 4665 is definitely brighter and more spread out, spanning almost
two full moons in my estimation.  Even better, it's just north of
Cebalrai, a 2.8 mag star, making it super easy to find. :)

Now, the disappointing part... the sky was bright tonight!  I could
barely make out most of my guide stars with the naked eye, making
observing really hard.  While I tried to view M10 and M12, the
seeing just wasn't good enough.  So, no globulars tonight. **sigh**
