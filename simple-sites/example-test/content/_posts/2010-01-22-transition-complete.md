Welcome to the new domain!  As per my previous post, I've made the migration to my new domain, "b-ark.ca".  Additionally, this website is now IPv6 accessible, so anyone with IPv6 access (either through a tunnel broker, 6to4, or teredo) will be able to reach this place over v6 instead of v4.

As an aside, Hurricane Electric and Afraid.org are *awesome* services.  Tunnel performance is spectacular (I see maybe 20ms extra latency over IPv6 versus IPv4), and they provide a routed /64, a full routed /48 if you want it, and support for reverse DNS delegation (so my IPv6 addresses will reverse resolve to my host names).

Meanwhile, Afraid.org has *excellent* support for IPv4 and dynamic DNS, and IPv6, both forward and reverse.  Now maybe I'll go apply for an "IPv6 Enabled" badge to stick on the website...
