I decided to install a little sketching tool for my Palm called DiddleBug, and with it, I've found it possible to express myself in new and unique ways, by unlocking my latent artistic talent.  With it, I've been able to tap into the deep well of my being, to create works of art that would have otherwise been impossible.  You can see the result yourself.  He's my new site logo.  Nice, eh?  

Of course, I must admit, I also wanted to spruce this place up a little bit more and add some colour.  I think it worked out nicely.  Don't you?

Update:  Courtesy of lenore, my logo is now named Mr. Squiggle.
