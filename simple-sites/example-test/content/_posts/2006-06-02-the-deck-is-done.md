Well, sort of.  There's still plenty of work to do, like installing railings, stairs, evening out edges, installing facia, and other such things, but the bulk of the work (framing and decking) is complete!

Now, it's been a while since my last update, and **some** people are really interested in seeing some pictures.  So, I thought it about time to post a few shots of my work.  First off, I have a couple photos showing the completed framing:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Deck_Frame_1 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Deck_Frame_1" --data="Deck_Frame_1" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}
{% lightbox /assets/images/Deck_Frame_2 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Deck_Frame_2" --data="Deck_Frame_2" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

As you can see, it turned out pretty well (thought not perfect... the right-most joist on the upper deck isn't quite square with the rest of the frame).  Truth be told, I think framing was the most enjoyable part.  It's not terribly tedious, but it really gives you a feel for what the final outcome is going to be like.

Speaking of which, second, I have a couple shots of the completed deck.  The first is an attempted overhead panorama.  Unfortunately, the image is a bit warped, but it gives you a decent look at the final product:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Deck_Panorama --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Deck_Panorama" --data="Deck_Panorama" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

And lastly, an elevation shot, showing the deck in profile against the house:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Deck_Elevation --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Deck_Elevation" --data="Deck_Elevation" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

Not too bad, eh?  Again, there are a few warts that I, having built the thing, are probably more likely to notice, and only one semi-major thing:  it appears the lower deck shifted forward a bit during construction, and so the front beam and posts are leaning forward slightly:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Deck_Lean --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Deck_Lean" --data="Deck_Lean" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

I suspect this is minor, so I'm not terribly worried about it, but worst case I can unscrew the joists, lift the deck (which isn't has hard as you'd think), push the beam back, and rescrew.

So there you have it!  'course, now we need to find a way to actually use the 250+ square feet of deck we now have...
