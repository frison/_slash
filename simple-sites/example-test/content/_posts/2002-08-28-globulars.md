Yay!  My first globulars!  Specifically M15 and M2.  Both of these
are quite bright objects (mag 5.8 and 6.4, respectively... I think
:), hence making them (theoretically) easy to find.  Again, I wasted
a lot of time verifying that my guide star Enif was really
Enif... **sigh** :)

Anyway, once I had them in my scope, they were pretty easy to spot.
Both were relatively dim in the light-polluted sky of Edmonton,
making indirect observing necessary.  Both looked like fuzzy blobs
in my 10mm eyepiece, with M2 looking slightly mishapen.  M15
definitely had the brighter core of the two, as well, which makes
sense, given it's density.  Definitely very cool.  I can't imagine
what they must look like in a clear, dark sky. :)
