Why did I install you, [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com)?  WHY???

Okay, so a little background, StumbleUpon is this browser extension that adds a toolbar to your browser.  If you hit "Stumble", it'll search for websites it thinks you might like.  Then you rate them.  It has categories, so you can select particular subject matter, and you can even post comments and read what other people have to say.

Well, as you can imagine, this is an immense time waster.  I mean, it's **really** bad.  It's like the [Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) front page, except less work.  And the stuff I've found?  Well, here's a few gems:

* [Taylor Hall Planet Perplex](http://www.planetperplex.com/en/item278)
* [Kid Creatures](http://drawergeeks.com/Kid_Creatures/Kid_Creatures.html)
* The above lead me to: [The Monster Engine](http://www.themonsterengine.com/)
* [Gummi Bear Sculptures](http://www.saynotocrack.com/index.php/2007/03/09/wow-gummi-bear-sculptures/)
* [T-Shirt Stencil Tutorial](http://www.neitherhipnorfunky.com/?p=106)
* [Crazy Bathroom](http://www.snopes.com/photos/arts/toilet.asp).  StumbleUpon actually found a blog entry on this subject, and some co-workers tracked it down on Snopes.

And those are just the things I thought were **really** cool.  I just wish I hadn't found yet another way to procrastinate at work.

**Update:**

I just came across [this](http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/).  It has photos and virtual tours of various Asian temples and other buildings.  Very very neat.
