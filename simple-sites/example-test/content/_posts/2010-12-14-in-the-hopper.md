Yes, believe it or not, I have a hopper.  I never empty the hopper, but the hopper exists, and there are items in it.  Usually the hopper is overridden with work concerns, be it actual, day-job work, or the consulting stuff I do on the side.  Or it may be overriden by more immediate, viceral concerns:  sleeping, eating, and so forth.  But given it's the Christmas season and things are slowing down a bit, it's possible... just possible... I might be able to work on some items from the hopper.

First on the list?  Earn myself a [Blackberry PlayBook](http://us.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/).  They currently have a very simple developer contest:  Get an application approved and published in their app store by February first, and you get a **free** PlayBook.  A free $500 tablet?  Sounds good to me!  I've already got the [SDK](http://us.blackberry.com/developers/tablet/) installed (the first SDK released is based on Adobe's [AIR](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/) platform), and the simulator up and running, so now I just need to start coding.  The current plan is a recipe manager application... 'course, I just need to decide how to present such an application on a tablet device.  Fun!

And the second item?  Update [savsender](../projects/savsender.md) to build against the latest devkitarm.  And while I'm at it, get the code up on github.  This was triggered by an email I received back at the end of October asking for an update, and given how simple the codebase is, it's a request I should be able to fulfill during my spare time.

So, here's hoping this is a productive Christmas!  Assuming I don't just sleep my way through it...
