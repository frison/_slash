I've taken my first crack at building a responsive CSS layout for this thing.  It's not perfect... the sidebar links are completely unavailable in the mobile layout, right now.  But it's infinitely more readable.  And while I was at it, I resolved a number of other little pains and niggles in the layout that irritated me.

Of course, I'm still not actually writing any content worth reading, but hey, at least if you do read what's here, you can do it on your phone without pain!
