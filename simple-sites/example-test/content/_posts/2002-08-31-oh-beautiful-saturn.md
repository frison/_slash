So, I finally got around to taking my scope out of the apartment.
It really is an excellent instrument.  A very nice size, yet still
portable: the scope itself easily fits in my backpack, and the mount
is fairly light and portable.  Very cool!  As a result, I finally
got a chance to view Saturn!  What a view!  The planet and its rings
were <B>easily</B> visible, with some atmospheric banding visible.
Two of its moons, Titan and Rhea, were also visible.  Too bad I
still don't read star charts well, otherwise I could have added some
more open clusters to my list. :)
