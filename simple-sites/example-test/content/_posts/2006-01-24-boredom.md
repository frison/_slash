It's amazing what a little boredom can do.  After exploring [Sensei's Library](http://senseis.xmp.net/), I thought to myself, you know what Oddmuse is missing?  A module for displaying Go boards!  Well, here it is!

Edit:  Okay, I lied, this worked when I was using Oddmuse, but now that I'm on Jekyll it doesn't anymore... so we'll just have to use our imaginations.

Now, it doesn't quite support all the features of the formatter at SL, and it uses a different board definition format (it's more flexible... although, in truth, it was mainly designed to be as easy to parse as possible :), but as you can see, it certainly does the job.  I even worked a little magic so that text in the captions is formatted just like any other wiki text!  Snazzy, eh?

Anyway, if anyone is interested in this thing, just write a comment and I'll put it up.

You can also see that I've been fiddling around with the formatting so that text flows around the goban.  I'm not sure how I feel about it, just yet (if there were multiple boards one wished to discuss, it could get annoying), but it does look kinda cool.
