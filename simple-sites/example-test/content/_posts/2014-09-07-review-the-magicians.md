The book is slow to start and it often feels as though Grossman is going through the motions. But the driving second half more than makes up for it. And with choice quotes like:

> "Look, who's the talking bear here?" Quentin snapped. "Is it you? Are you the talking fucking bear? All right. So shut the fuck up."

The meta-fiction is downright entertaining.

Some might find the book needlessly angsty, and there's some merit to that complaint. But its an interesting alternative look at what it would mean to discover a magical world embedded in our own.
