Ugh, finally home.  It was a good trip, I have to say... nice and relaxed for a change, rather than heavily regimented.  And I got to spend money.  Too much money. :)

And speaking of spending money, I've finally got some shots of my new toys.  First off, I have a couple pics of my Palm:

{% lightbox /assets/images/TX_Off --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/TX_Off" --data="TX_Off" --img-style="max-width:100;" %} {% lightbox /assets/images/TX_Blazer --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/TX_Blazer" --data="TX_Blazer" --img-style="max-width:100;" %} {% lightbox /assets/images/TX_Scumm --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/TX_Scumm" --data="TX_Scumm" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

Left-to-right, there's a shot of it off.  Second, an image of Blazer (the packaged web browsr) rendering this website.  Lastly, we have ScummVM playing The Secret of Monkey Island.  Pretty neat, eh? :)

Next, I have a pic of my newest toy, my snazzy earphones:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Shure_E2Cs --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Shure_E2Cs" --data="Shure_E2Cs" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

After using them for the drive back, I gotta say:  awesome purchase!  The noise isolation alone makes them worth every penny.  Heck, for a while I just used them as standard earplugs.  With the foam inserts, they drop high- and mid-range frequency noise dramatically (Shure's claims are around 15db noise reduction), while still making it possible to listen to conversations when the music is off.  

With the music on, the sound is excellent.  High- and mid-range frequencies are really nicely articulated, and, with the plugs properly installed, the bass is surprisingly good.  And I'm still amazed at how little power I need to drive these things.  They literally require half the volume, as compared to my cheap Sony buds.  This is, I suspect, a combination of noise isolation, relatively low impedence, and significantly reduced leakage (due to the plugs and the fact that the drivers are completely enclosed).

The gist:  these are, hands down, the best pair of buds I've ever used.  Very sweet.
