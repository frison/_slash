So as I mentioned previously, now that I have my [MythTV](../projects/MythTV.md) system rolled out (fairly successfully, I think), I've found myself playing a lot of old games that I haven't touched in years.  Sure, in the past, I've been able to play these games on a computer, but there's nothing quite like being able to experience them in my livingroom on a proper (nice and fuzzy) TV with a decent joypad.  However, the joypads I'm using (are nice cheap USB Logitech pads) don't do a good job of replicating that true Arcade Experience (tm).

Enter [XGaming](http://www.xgaming.com).  These guys are in the business of building arcade-grade gear that can be interfaced with a PC, for use primarily with [MAME](http://www.mame.net).  XGaming have been in the biz for quite a while, marketing their X-Arcade stick, a control built with arcade-grade joysticks and buttons, mounted on a nice, heavy base.  Very nice.  And at $129, their Dual Joystick, which sports two full control sets mounted on a single platform, is an absolute steal.

But then evil-Jeremy, my Go playing friend and source of generally bad financial influence, pointed me at [Treyonics Controls](http://www.treyonicscontrols.com/).  Like XGaming, they build arcade-grade PC-compatible sticks, but their Centurion **really** stands out.  Why?  Well, it sports 4 more buttons than the XArcade, which is nice, but more importantly, it is equipped with a heavy-duty trackball **and** dial!  Finally, I can play Arkanoid the way it was meant to be played, right in the comfort of my own livingroom!  Further, their sticks are 4/8-way switchable, meaning you can play games like Donkey Kong, which used a 4-way stick, on proper, authentic controls, while still being able to use the 8-way stick for high-twitch games like Street Fighter II.  My only fear is that they don't currently have prices available... I can't imagine it's cheap (though damned tempted, whatever the price :).

Of course, all this got me thinking:  what if, one day, I could build a proper arcade cabinet?  And that's when I found [arcadecontrols.com](http://arcadecontrols.com/arcade.htm).  These guys provide all the information and directions you need to build your own cabinet from scrap or pre-built parts, including explanations of various materials and technologies, wiring diagrams, tips and tricks, and links to part suppliers.  Could make for a very cool project once I get my media room done...
