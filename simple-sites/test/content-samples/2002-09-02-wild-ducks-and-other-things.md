Ahh... a cool night in Edmonton, but a good one, nonetheless.  The
sky was fairly clear tonight, and minus some clouds, observing
conditions were not too bad.  So, I nailed a couple more open
clusters tonight.  The first, M25, is a nice little sparse cluster
in Scutum, and fairly close to the horizon.  Definitely a pretty
little cluster, with many bright stars.

The other big one, and the one I've been trying to get, was the
Wild Duck Cluster, or M11 in the Messier Catalogue.  This is an
open cluster as well, although you wouldn't know it to look at
it.  It's so compact that, in my telescope, it looks very similar
to a globular cluster, just a little less compact.  But, with
a relative magnitude of 5.8, it was visible even in binoculars.
Definitely a sight to behold!  My next hopeful is M22, a bright
globular which is in Sagittarius.  Perhaps tomorrow. :)
