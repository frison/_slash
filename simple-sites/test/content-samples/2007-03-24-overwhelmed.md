It's too much.  To vast.  Can I really do this?  Am I up to the task?  Or am I being too ambitious, simply overestimating what I'm capable of?  Honestly, I don't know.  I could abbreviated it, keep it small and contained, avoid letting it grow or get out of hand.  But should I?  Maybe I should just let it spread out, let it drag me along for the ride...

As an aside, anyone who actually reads this thing (yes, all three of you), may remember that I said this idea I'm currently playing with had been [bouncing around in my brain for the last couple months](Blog-2007-03-19.md).  Well, it turns out I was wrong.  I was lying in bed recently when I remembered that, way back when we were still living in our apartment downtown, I was already thinking about getting back into creating writing, and already groping around for interesting ideas.  One of these ideas I wrote down in a little text file and squirreled away, after which I subsequently forgot about it.  Then, a while back, as I was doing a little virtual house cleaning, I found the file, read through it, dismissed it as the wild ravings of a crazed lunatic, and promptly deleted it.

Well, oddly enough, it was this idea (or, at least the seeds of it), which sprung back into my mind.  Which all goes to show that 1) this "writing thing" isn't such a nutty flight of fancy after all, and 2) it's better to never throw an idea away... because, even if it's "bad", it could become the roots of something "good".
