Well, progress continues unabated on the NetHack port.  A little part of me is actually somewhat concerned over the fate of my marriage, given the sheer amount of time I've been spending on this thing.  But, on the (not so) bright side, Lenore's been so sick the last couple days, she's barely noticed that when I'm not attending to her needs, I'm hacking by the warm glowing warming glow of the laptop backlight.

Meanwhile, reception seems to be pretty positive, with most people of the opinion that yeah, my port seems to work pretty well.  Of course, that's not to say there isn't plenty more to do, and tons of bugs to fix (just this morning Jeremy pointed out an odd colour problem on corpses... ie, they're the wrong colour.  Not to mention the fact that, as of this writing, you can't write on the floor using just your finger), but it's certainly a comfortably playable port, especially with the snazzy ANSI graphics mode!

As for imminent work, I just cleaned up the textmode cursor stuff this morning after a brainwave hit me in the shower, which means things like projectiles move the cursor correctly.  Next, I think I'll fix the engraving bug Jeremy spotted, and take a look at the tile-mode invisibility bug that's been lingering since I first released the code.  And somewhere in there, I need to figure out why the corpses are the wrong colour... and... and... and...
