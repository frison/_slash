So I just had the weirdest salesman/door-to-door guy bother me.  This wasn't the usual hard sell thing, as I first expected.  Instead, what they wanted to do was place a sign on our property to advertise Honeywell (specifically, their home security products), and in exchange they would pay us.  How could I possibly say no??  Well, you see, the problem is I'm already pissed enough at the sheer ubiquity of advertising, and the last thing I wanted was my house to turn into a glorified billboard.  Not to mention the fact that I think home security systems are largely overrated (it's not like it would take more than ten minutes to break one of our windows and steal a bunch of valuables) and are nothing more than a way for companies to cash in on fear.

So, unsurprisingly, I said "fuck that"... though in somewhat more polite language.  But the best part was the guy's reaction.  "But... we're gonna pay you." he replied, as if the price of my soul, not to mention my values and dignity, were so easily purchased.  He seemed genuinely puzzled, not to mention a little put off, that I didn't want to become a Honeywell marketing tool.  

Well, to Mr. Marketing guy and to Honeywell, I say it again: **fuck that**.  I already have to constantly put up with advertisements.  Everytime I browse the web, turn on the TV (after I've already paid for cable), or go to the theatre (with a ticket I already paid for), I'm bathed in advertisements and product spots.  Why would I want to pollute my nice little neighbourhood with even more?
