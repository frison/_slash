So, I found myself watching the last half of Austin Powers on Fox tonight and, apparently, the following words are offensive (among others I'm sure I've forgotten):

1. fagina
2. scrotum
3. horny

Specifically, Alotta Fagina's name was changed to... get this... Alotta **Cleavage**.  Heck, they even tried to come up with some clever pronounciation (like "fagina"), in order to make it sound sorta like a joke.  So sad.

The "scrotum" censorship (did I just say that?) occurred during the oh-so-brilliant Dr. Evil speech.  Apparently, it was just fine for him to say "ritually shaved my testicles", but saying "a shorn scrotum" is just too much (though, to be fair, they may have cut down the speech for the sake of time, which would be a shame... it's one of the best parts of the movie...)  

And lastly, strangely enough, the word "horny" was replaced with the word "randy".  As if that makes any difference whatsoever.

Meanwhile, the whole scene with Austin naked in the background while Vanessa is talking on the phone and making sure to "accidentally" cover Austin's gear is presented in all it's glory, including the moment when Vanessa bites into a conveniently placed sausage while Austin is stretching... I just don't get it.
