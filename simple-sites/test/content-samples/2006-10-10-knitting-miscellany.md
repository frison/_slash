So blanket construction continues unabated.  In fact, in the three days I was in Regina for Thanksgiving, I completed another 4 1/2 panels, which brings me to a total of 9... over one third of the way there!  On the hex components, anyway.  'course, I still haven't blocked them out, but I'm sure I'll get around to that eventually.

On a separate but related note, quite a while ago, I embarked on a rather ambitious project:  to start a knitting wiki.  Unfortunately, as often happens with my projects, I made a reasonable amount of progress in secret before life got in the way and it ended up on the back-burner.  However, the recent discovery of another knitting wiki project on [Wikia](http://www.wikia.com) (a Wikimedia-powered free wiki-hosting service) has brough the project back to life.  For now.

See, apparently someone else had the same bright idea I did... and the same amount of dedication.  Thus, the Wikia site had been languishing for about a year, just waiting to be populated.  So I've decided to try and adopt the project.  I've already ported all my content over there, boosting the site from a measley 9 pages to a whopping 31, and I've started the process of lightly re-organizing things before generating new material.  My ultimate goal would be to generate an all-encompassing repository of knitting knowledge.  A resource that could rival those found in traditionally expensive (and difficult to find) knitting books.  Of course, we'll see how long it is before I get bored of the whole idea. :)

Of course, by now, you're probably wondering where it is.  Well, feel free to head over to [KnitWiki](http://knitwiki.wikia.com)!  And in case you're wondering, yes, those shots with the green yarn are pictures of me knitting.  And yes, taking them required some rather odd contortions...
