Well, I finally did it.  A couple weeks ago, I finally bit the bullet and replaced my aging [Palm TX](Blog-2006-02-07.md) with a brand spanking new fourth generation iPod Touch.

And so far?  **Fabulous**.

I'd been reluctant to buy a device to replace my old Palm, as none of the new hardware seemed all **that** compelling.  The Palm, with its 480x360 screen, has been comparable to anything on the market for a long long time.  And from a software standpoint, it already handled what I did most with it: read.

But with the new Touch, with it's gorgeous 960x640 screen, I finally had a reason to migrate.  And in doing so, I realized just how much the limitations of the TX were preventing me from truly using the device.

In particular, with the Touch, I suddenly find myself using it to:

* Read and write emails.
* Check and post to facebook.
* Chat online with people on Facebook and Google chat.
* Browse the web.
* Follow my RSS feeds.
* Track my TODO items.
* Keep notes in my personal wiki.
* Look things up in Wikipedia and IMDB.

All in addition to the usual tasks of reading and listening to music.  Most of this wasn't possible on my Palm because either the browser sucked, or the applications simply weren't available or comfortable to use due to the rather craptacular stylus-based input system.  Plus, the increased resolution of the 4g Touch makes reading small text a **lot** easier, and so reading and browsing the web is far more comfortable than on the TX.

As for apps, so far, my absolute favorite discoveries are:

**Trunk Notes**.  This has has replaced Wikidpad as my personal wiki, and allows me to create a web of interconnected text that can be browsed and edited from both my computer (through a web interface) or on the device itself.  Suddenly my entire recipe collection, my set of guitar tabs, and loads of other stuff, is available wherever I am!

**Appigo Todo**.  I'm actually getting things done.  It's bizarre.

**MobileRSS**.  It is what it says, and it works well.  Syncs with Google Reader.  Easy-to-use swipe gestures for moving between items.  Embedded browser.  Good stuff.

**Stanza**.  An e-book reader that integrates beautifully with [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), which runs on my laptop and acts as my e-book library.

Of course, there's tons of little tools and utilities I've bought along the way (GoodReader for PDF reading and annotating, Tunemark for streaming music, Dropbox, Google Earth, Skype, iSSH...), but these are the ones I use on a consistent, day-to-day basis.

And yes, before you ask, I've also jailbroken.  I'm not sure why, yet (although SBSettings is awfully nice), but it's fun to get a shell on the thing, even if it's just to say I can.
