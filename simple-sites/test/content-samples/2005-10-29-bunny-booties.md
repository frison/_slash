For those new to this place, my wife and I share our lives with two pet [Rabbits](Rabbits.md), Herbie and Chloe.  Well, the last year has been pretty hard on Chloe:  so far she's developed four [Abscesses](Abscesses.md), three on her back feet and, now, one on her front.  It's been fun.  Real fun.  

Well, her most recent abscess has required me to come up with some method for protecting her foot.  The problem is, it needs to be fairly tightly fit, reasonably durable, and most importantly cheap and easy to replace, since she **will** destroy them, even with the damned cone on.

So, I decided it was about time I actually used my knitting skills for something useful and came up with this:

Pretty basic, but it works surprisingly well.  I can custom fit them, which is really nice, and I can bang one out in around 20 minutes, meaning if she does destroy it, I can just make another.  I've also experimented with a couple other variations, like using decreases near the top to tighten it up, and I even created one using reinforced heel stitch, to see if would stand up to more of a beating.  But, in the end, the basic Stockinette pattern seems to work the best.  Maybe next time I'll throw in a couple cables, etc. ;)
