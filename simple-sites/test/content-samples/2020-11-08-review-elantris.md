It's been about a week and a half since I finished reading Elantris, which means once again this review is coming late, well after my initial impressions have faded.  So, don't expect too much.

Despite being his first work, this feels like classic Sanderson to me.  We have reversals of classic fantasy tropes.  We have powerful female characters leading the fight for justice, something which I'm discovering is a bit of a fixture in Sanderson's work.  We have, of course, a fairly coherent magic system whose rules are the key to the big reveal at the end of the novel.  And, of course, we have a bit of a Sanderson avalanche at the end.

I will say, the slow reveal of the magic in this world was a *bit* frustrating, if only because it proves so critical in the final acts of the book.  But, that issue aside, this book was well paced and exciting.

But what really made this book work for me was the characters.

Unlike the cast in The Stormlight Archives, which I generally find a bit difficult to like at times, Raoden and Sarene are both just... good.  In fact, if I had to criticize, Raoden is a bit *too* good to be realistic at times.  Sarene, by contrast, is strong, biting, witty, clever, determined, and in general just delightful.

Similarly, I found Hrathen's journey to be a really engaging.  As a foil for Sarene he was a perfect match, and I enjoyed the fact that they both clearly respected one another.  And I will absolutely admit that I didn't expect his storyline to end the way it did.

About the only real disappointment for me was Dilaf, if only because he was just so... stereotypical.  I enjoy a good villain as much as anyone, but the fact he was just so utterly one-dimensional was, to me, a bit of a miss.

Notably, having read [Warbreaker](./2020-10-12-review-warbreaker.md) recently, I've definitely noticed some common motifs.  We have our main characters fighting to avoid a war.  We have powerful, godlike figures laid low.  We see the perversion of religion into a tool for the wicked.  Heck, we even have powerful women thrust into a marriage for political purposes.  This isn't really a criticism so much as an observation, and now that I'm re-reading Mistborn, I wonder if similar themes will pop out.

Anyway, I don't think I have anything else coherent to say.  I just wanted to get something written down before I get too deep into Mistborn.
