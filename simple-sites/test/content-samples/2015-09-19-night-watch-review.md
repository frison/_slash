This, right here, is a Discworld novel for Discworld fans. The Watch have always been my favourite characters, and Vimes is certainly my favourite of the bunch. So obviously an origin story about the man is going to go over well. But this isn't lazy fan service, and is replete with Pratchett's beautifully incisive writing, teaching us about what it means to be a "copper" when the world is falling to pieces.

According to Goodreads (which is where I pulled this review[^1]), I read this book way back in September of 2015, and to this day, this book still sticks with me.  "Night Watch" truly exemplifies everything that makes Terry's writing so perfect:  Incisive satire that's made powerful and relatable through wonderful characters.

[^1]: My intention is to slowly suck my reviews out of Goodreads and publish them here.
