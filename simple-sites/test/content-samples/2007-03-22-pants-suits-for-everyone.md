Some of you may remember my entry about the infamous [Knitted Pants Suit](Blog-2006-05-04.md).  I still consider this one of my all-time favorite knitted items, and for the longest time, I bemoaned the lack of a pattern from which I could replicate this masterful work of art.  Well, a while back, I decided to send a private message to the poster of the entry where I first encountered this gem (the second link in the aforementioned blog entry), in the hopes that I might acquire the pattern and perhaps create one of my own... you know, to wear around the house, or for one of those wild nights out for which Lenore and I are truly infamous.

Well, as it happens, not a week or two later, I got a response from the individual in question.  Yes, he did have the pattern.  And yes, he would get me a copy!  And so it was that I came into possession of three PDFs which will enable me to create my very own knitted pants suit.

Of course, it would seem unfair to keep this pattern to myself (it's bad enough I've held on to it this long without sharing it with the world), and so I offer it up here (yes, I realize this is copyright infringement, but I just hope Brunswick will understand).  Heck, maybe myself and any other interested knitters could each create our own renditions of this masterpiece, that we may then compare our interpretations, and, in the process, enrich the world with the knitted pants suits that it so woefully lacks.
