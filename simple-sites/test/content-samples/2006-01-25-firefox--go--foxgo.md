Man, I really have Go on the mind lately.  This time, I'm releasing a very early version of a new [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com) extension I'm working on called [FoxGo](../projects/FoxGo.md).  It's a very basic SGF viewer that integrates directly into Firefox, which is pretty darn handy if, like me, you tend to browse games on [GoBase](http://www.gobase.org) or play games on the [Dragon Go Server](http://www.dragongoserver.net).  Of course, one can't release a GUI program without providing a requisite screenshot, so...

{% lightbox /assets/images/FoxGo_Screenshot --thumb="/assets/thumbs/FoxGo_Screenshot" --data="FoxGo_Screenshot" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

As you can see, it does all the basic SGF-viewer-type-things, allowing one to move up and down the game tree, move back and forth between variations, and so forth.  'course, it's missing some very notable things:  A game tree.  Icons for the variation switching buttons.  Editing features.  Etc.  Etc.  Ad nauseum.  But it certainly accomplishes the basics, and is my primary tool for exploring SGFs, walking through variations, etc.
