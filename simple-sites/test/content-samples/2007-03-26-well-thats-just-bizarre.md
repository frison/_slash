I think I just finished a chapter in the **middle** of a story.  I don't know how it happened, really... I started writing a few days ago, focusing on this idea that I've been making reference to incessantly (or, perhaps tantilizingly?  Yeah... didn't think so), and today, after hitting the 3500 word mark and the end of what I thought was the first chapter, I decided to stop and ask myself how I wanted to progress.  Suddenly, as I sat there staring at the monitor, it dawned on me that what I'd just written more correctly belongs in the middle of a larger work... what the heck??

So now I get to start all over, this time at the actual beginning... hopefully, when I reach the middle, things will fit together all nice and neat.  Somehow, I doubt it.

An aside:  

If one were to use Orkut or Myspace as a population sample, one might come to conclusion that the bulk of the people in this world are, in fact, functionally illiterate...
