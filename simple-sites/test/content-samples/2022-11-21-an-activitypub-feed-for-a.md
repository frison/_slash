An ActivityPub feed for a blog is absolutely doable, it just requires work.  For example, a quick search turns up an ActivityPub plugin for Wordpress.  Heck, micro.blog supports it natively.  There's also bots out there that'll auto-syndicate posts from an RSS feed to a Mastodon account.  Unfortunately it's just not very widely available or adopted (yet!).
