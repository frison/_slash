Over the years, I've read a reasonably wide range of stuff, running the gamut from comedy and drama to horror and science fiction, both classic and contemporary.  But for some reason, whenever I get tired of finding new things to read, or just need to dig into something familiar and light hearted (yet still weighty and thoughtful, if I wish), I return to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".  There's something about Mr. Adams' brilliant, canted, quirky take on humanity that I just can't get enough of.  Heck, the very title of this blog is an homage to his wonderful work.

Well, today, I came across a previously unpublished [interview](http://www.darkermatter.com/issue1/douglas_adams.php) with the man (appeared on Slashdot, originally) from back in 1978, before HHGTG really took off, and I am once again reminded of why I enjoy his work so much, and why his loss was such a sad event.  One of my favorite quotes is this:

<blockquote>
If The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes money, I shall enjoy that. But what I'll enjoy most is having proved that you don't have to underestimate people. I don't like the notion that you set yourself up as saying "This is what people like, therefore this is what we'll do." That's patronizing.
</blockquote>

So for any fans of Adams' work, or HHGTG, check it out.  It's an interesting read about a man that is sorely missed (a phrase I rarely turn in reference to celebrities).
