"... and he just, I dunno, disappeared," he finished, taking a sip of his coffee, steam rising from the dark surface and condensing on his thick glasses.

"What do you mean, 'disappeared'," the man across the table asked, a puzzled frown creasing the dark skin of his forehead as he reached for his own up.  "Where did he go?  What happened to him?  People don't just disappear, you know."

"Honestly," the other man said, putting down his mug, "I don't know.  He just left.  Took his coat and his keys, hopped in his car," he reached over and grabbed the nearly empty sugar dispenser, pouring the remaining contents into his cup as he continued, white granules scattering on the dark surface of the table between them, like islands in a sea, "and left.  Never said a word to his friends, his wife, his kids... no one."  The clink of spoon against porcelain punctuated the silence that followed, the dark liquid swirling and eddying in his cup.

"I just don't understand," his companion said, taking a sip of his coffee, "How could someone do that?  Just up and leave like that?  I could never do that," I think, anyway, a voice in his mind said.  The man in the glasses shrugged, himself unsure.  "I mean, I talked to Mike, he seemed like such a nice guy.  And then he does this?  Seems like a dick move to me."

"Who knows," the other man said, "maybe he had his reasons.  Really, I didn't know him that well.  Did you?"  The man across the table shook his head, "See?  Heck, no one seemed to.  So who knows what happened.  For all we know his wife beat him or cheated on him or something.  But, whatever happened, he's gone now, and I'm bettin' he ain't comin' back."  

"Bizarre," his companion said, his finger tapping against his cup, the rhythmic thumping setting off waves in his coffee. "People just don't disappear like that!"
