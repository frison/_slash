Wow, it's been a while.  Three years?!  Yeesh... well, now that we've finally moved into the new house, which is further out from the city core, hopefully I'll get around to doing more observing.

Speaking of which, I decided to observe Jupiter tonight.  It's setting quite early these days, so I expected a lot of atmospheric disturbance, but there was surprisingly little!  The planet face didn't have a lot of detail at roughly 100x, though light and dark regions were visible (no spot, though it was facing us).

Of the [Galilean Moons](../Galilean_Moons.md) visible, Io, Calisto, and Ganymede were present, forming a rough line to one side of the planet.  Quite pretty, actually.
