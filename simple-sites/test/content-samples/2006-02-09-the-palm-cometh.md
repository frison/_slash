My Palm has arrived!  Definitely speedy, since I placed the order on Saturday, leaving Monday to prep order, Tuesday to ship, Wednesday morning to update the damn order tracking website, and Thursday at lunch time for arrival.

So now I wait for it to charge.  What then?  I have no idea... though I really should be doing something work-related.  Maybe I'll figure out how to check my email or browse the web.
