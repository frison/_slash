Well, it's hard to believe but my two weeks of vacation are coming to a close and tomorrow morning I return to the grind.  It says a lot about my mental state before my break that I feel like another two weeks would be welcome, but alas, until I manage to earn myself a sabbatical or, some day, retirement, I suppose this will have to do.

As for this blogging project, I'm really glad I set myself this writing goal!  For folks who have their own blog but struggle to get motivated to write, this approach--setting a queue of topics over a fixed period of time and then tackling them steadily--was very motivating and rewarding!  I definitely recommend it as a fun way to get inspired.

I was particularly happy with how a theme emerged across the various posts.  And I felt pretty darn smug when, in the [January 1st episode](https://slate.com/podcasts/slate-money/2022/01/one-to-two-years-in-review) of [Slate Money](https://slate.com/podcasts/slate-money), [Stacey-Marie Ishmael](https://twitter.com/s_m_i), a writer and journalist who's much smarter and articulate than me, summarized the theme of this blog series: the pandemic is making the invisible visible.  I have to admit, when I heard her say that, I felt a rush of validation that maybe I was onto something!

So, where did I end up clocking in?  Well, over the course of the last two weeks, counting short posts, I wrote a grand total of approximately 13700 words.  Counting only long form posts, roughly 12900 or about 800 words a day.  Not bad at all!  And I know of at least one person who actually read most of them![^1]

Anyway, for folks who weren't following this project as it was being published and want to check it out, here's a list of the long form posts in the order in which they were written:

* [Blogging for the Holidays](2021-12-18-blogging-for-the-holidays.md)
* [Grappling with Viruses](2021-12-19-grappling-with-viruses.md)
* [Grappling with Statistics](2021-12-20-grappling-with-statistics.md)
* [Revisiting The Lord of the Rings](2021-12-23-revisiting-lotr.md)
* [Grappling with Misinformation](2021-12-24-grappling-with-misinformation.md)
* [Grappling with Supply Chains](2021-12-26-grappling-with-supply-chains.md)
* [Grappling with Labour Markets](2021-12-27-grappling-with-labour-markets.md)
* [Grappling with Inflation](2021-12-30-grappling-with-inflation.md)
* [A New Years Post](2022-01-01-a-new-years-post.md)

For those few people who actually stuck it out and read these posts, either as they were written or afterward, thank you!  I hope they were interesting and worth the time.

And for those folks who've heard me going on about these topics throughout 2021 and *still* read these posts, a special shout out!  You're a trooper![^2]

Finally, I hope everyone had a happy holidays in spite of all the difficulties of the past two years, and I truly believe this next year we'll see things start to get better.

Have a fantastic 2022!
