So, I was perusing the [MythTV](../projects/MythTV.md) mailing lists, when I came across a post which linked to this device (actually, it linked to the 1210, but the 1220 is better, IMHO):

[DS-1220 SATA Enclosure](http://www.norcotek.com/DS-1220.php)

In short, for $800, you get a rack-mountable enclosure that will take up to 12 SATA drives and present them to a host PC.  Which means I could turn that into a massive MythTV storage device!  As a bonus, it comes with literally all the gear you need to get the thing working:  all the drive mounts, cabling, an eSATA PCI card, screws... it's a very complete package.

Unfortunately, I should probably actually, you know, finish our basement first before I start drooling over such things.  And after that, I'd still want to buy a proper server rack.  And a couple rackmount cases so I could rack up my firewall and Myth backend.  And then there's all the gear I want for my media room, such as an HD-capable projector, screen, gear for a myth frontend, some sort of audio system...
