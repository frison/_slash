Well, everyone, I'd like to introduce my new friend, Ted:

Yup, my starter lives!  And his name is Ted.  

For those interested in the gory details, I used the recipe from [here](http://www.wildyeastblog.com/2007/07/13/raising-a-starter/).  24 hours in, things looked bubbly.  36 hours in, it was really bubbly.  Then the drought of days 3-5... it smelled quite sour, but there was virtually no bubbling to be seen.

At this stage, it felt like things were settling in to a rut, so I made a few adjustments, modifying the feeding as follows:

1. Switched from 75%/25% white/rye ratio to 50%/50%.
2. Increased the hydration from 100% to 120%, give or take.

Two days later, and you can see the results.  It smells lightly sour, yeasty, and it's doubling in 8 hours.  Woo!  So tomorrow, it's sour rye... I hope.
