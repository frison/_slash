Well, it's been almost two weeks now, and the vimming continues unabated.  So far, I have to say, I'm pretty happy with the change.  The simple fact that I can run it in a [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen) session without feeling crippled has been wonderful, particularly since I've been frequently moving my editing sessions between work and home lately (all I need to do is ssh in, and do a 'screen -DR', and voila, my work environment is migrated over).

As for the RSI, other than the usual stiffness from long periods of typing, the other symptoms (things like shooting pains in the hands) have been reduced or eliminated, proving once more that emacs finger is real and dangerous!  And yes, I realize that I could've just swapped my capslock and control keys, but I use my capslock as a third modifier, so that doesn't work as nicely for me. :)

Meanwhile, my vocabulary of vi commands continues to expand.  My biggest problem is simply remembering to use vi/vim shortcut keys and commands instead of doing things manually.  This is especially a problem for me since I'm a fast enough typist that I'll often resort to brute forcing things, rather than trying to be speedy and clever.  Thing likes Ctrl+n for completion while coding is **incredibly** convenient, and a significant timesaver, assuming I'm smart enough to remember to use it.  And being able to type things like 'ct;<new code here>' is really darn handy, when I don't accidentally find myself typing 'xxxxxxxxxxi<new code here>' by mistake.  But, given time, I suspect I'll internalize more of the commands and my editing speed will continue to increase.

So, the moral of the story is that it looks like Vim has a new convert!  I have officially switched sides in the infamous [Editor_war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war).
