As if having the in-laws over on the weekend didn't make things hectic enough, it was also Mother's Day on Sunday (which is, in part, why the in-laws were here), and to top it off, I was actually feeling motivated and decided to get a bunch of TODO items off my list.

So, in between hanging out with the mother- and brother-in-law and joining my sister and mom for a nice brunch at The Manor Caf&eacute; (which is, BTW, an excellent restaurant... the brunch was really fantastic), I also:

1. Got the push mower assembled and the front yard lawn cut.
2. Rented a lawn roller and compressed the soil in the backyard and parging, after which I started staking out the garden area (though Lenore and I still need to discuss general positioning, etc ;).

And, as if that wasn't enough, I also did a little bunny-cage-refactoring.  You see, we have this giant, home-made bunny cage, depicted below (note, this is an old picture... the cage went through some other minor refactoring since this photo was taken):

{% lightbox /assets/images/Original_Bunny_Mansion --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Original_Bunny_Mansion" --data="Original_Bunny_Mansion" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

Now, the first thing you might ask yourself is, why so big?  Well, the plan was to have our two bunnies co-habitate eventually, but alas, that is not to be.  So, until yesterday, Herbie, our smaller rabbit, was in the giant cage, and Chloe was in a rather small floor cage (since her [Abscesses](Abscesses.md) made it necessary to keep her cage really clean, a task more easily achieved in a smaller cage).  This was doubly silly since Herbie never really used the upper floors, anyway.

But all that has changed!  I decided this situation was downright silly (not to mention space inefficient) and modded the mansion, dividing it in half, thus creating two cages, one in the top half and one in the bottom, with Herbie remaining in the bottom, and Chloe now inhabiting the top.  Photos to come once I get around to taking some.

Meanwhile, tonight the plan is to get the final garden position staked out, the compost started, and perhaps the unkillable Rhubarb in the ground.  And if I still have time, maybe I'll start planting the annuals that we bought on the weekend...

Update:

Here's the image of the new cage layout.  Images of the yardwork, still pending.
