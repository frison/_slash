Okay, so we were dumb.  We decided to lay down our topsoil and then wait months and months before getting our final grade approval, after which we could look toward planting a lawn.  Well, it turns out that the local flora absolutely **love** fresh black dirt, and the result was a veritable forest, nay, jungle of weeds.

The problem is, tomorrow we are supposed to have some inspector come to verify our final grade.  And I can only assume that the poor sucker will want to, you know, be able to see the ground.  So, I decided it was time to weed.  Two and a half hours later, give or take, I was done, and the result was this:

{% lightbox /assets/images/Image-2fa0bd2997d55dd8 --thumb="/assets/images/thumbs/Image-2fa0bd2997d55dd8" --data="Image-2fa0bd2997d55dd8" --img-style="max-width:100;" %}

Notice the barbecue, which I placed beside the pile for reference (note, the pile is more oblong than round, so you're seeing the broadside in that photo).

The weeds were so bad that the process basically involved blindly grabbing and pulling at whatever I could find.  Which is, coincidentally, very similar to one of the basic forms in my highly refined street fighting technique (the other being the Homer Simpson form... you know, crying like a little baby until your opponent turns away in disgust, at which point you kick some back!).
