So it turns out that buying a new backup device for my DS has had an extremely detrimental effect on my writing frequency.  Actually, it's worse than that... it's a combination of a new backup device, with Nethack.  Not good.

In particular, I got the idea in my head to take [NethackDS](http://stuartp.commixus.com/nhds/) and basically rewrite the user interface, to make it more comfortable to use.  See, NethackDS takes the simplest approach to a port, making extensive use of an on-screen keyboard and an ultra-small font to provide an experience very similar to Nethack for Unix.  However, the interface is far from efficience, and is pretty tough to read, to boot.

And so I took it upon myself to spruce things up.  Now, I haven't gotten very far.  In fact, I've only just gotten some text on the screen (though this required porting a BDF parser and writing a bit of rendering code), but progress is being made... so, hopefully in a few weeks, I'll have a fancy new DS port of Nethack to play with.

I'm not sure this is a good thing.
