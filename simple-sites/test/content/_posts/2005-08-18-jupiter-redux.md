Well, I just had to go out again last night and check out Jupiter.  With it setting earlier and earlier these days, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to observe it.  

Unfortunately, the weather has been very unpleasant lately (it's mid-August, but it feels like mid-September!), and so seeing wasn't great, with a lot of atmospheric turbulence.  Still, I got a beautiful view of the [Galilean Moons](../Galilean_Moons.md) again.  It's fascinating seeing them change position... rather than being in a straight line, as in my previous observations, this time Io and Ganymede were to one side and Callisto to the other.  Just beautiful.
