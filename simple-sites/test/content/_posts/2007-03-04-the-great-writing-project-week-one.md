Well, here marks the end of the first week of my great writing experiment.  As a recap, in case you can't be bothered to scroll down two posts to read about it for yourself, I'm currently attempting to write at least 1,000 words per day (crappy or otherwise), minus a break day (which, last week, was on the Wednesday).  Note, this does not, unfortunately, include my blog entries, which don't really qualify as "fiction" per say (or "interesting" or "entertaining", for that matter).

Anyway, so far, I think things have gone pretty well.  At this point, the biggest failure has been my writing schedule, which suffered from a need to bank hours for a trip (which, as it turns out, was aborted for reasons I'm not going to bother getting in to here), meaning I wasn't arriving home until quarter to six, and not finishing my writing until nearly eight, depending on how slow the words were coming.  Additionally, my Saturday writing got postponed to today, thanks to a busy day out and about (BTW, Zodiac <nowiki>==</nowiki> pretty decent movie). But other than those minor hiccups, I think I can declare week 1 of the great writing project a, as Borat would say, Great Success!

Of course, I'm not implying anything regarding the **quality** of the work so far produced.  As far as I know, it's nearly 6100 words (soon to be 7100) of complete and utter crap.  But, hey, at least it's my crap, right?  Then again, I'm not sure Lenore will be so cognizant of that silver lining when I foist this monstrosity on her.

**Update:**

7097.  You know, the second 1,000 was a lot harder than the first...
