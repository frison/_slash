I was pretty sure I knew how this book was going to end when I started it, but that didn't stop it from breaking my heart.

This is *the* book I would hand to someone who was new to Science Fiction. Beautiful, insightful, and incredibly powerful.

Update (2020-02-26):

I'm writing this long *long* after originally writing this sparse little review.  Two years after reading this book, it continues to haunt me as one of the most emotionally powerful, affecting books I've ever read.  I suspect if I read the last page or two, I'd start crying once again (after the original read I was sobbing uncontrollably).  This book is truly remarkable.
