Finally!  Stupid power outage frying my stupid PSU.  Well, that or it was already dying, and the power outage just made that evident.  Oh, and then there's the stick of RAM I discovered was bad.  BUT, all is now well.  Until the next thing breaks.

**Update:**

Turns out, after I upgraded to Apache2, I neglected to re-enable the suEXEC module, which meant that any attempt to save content to the wiki would have failed.  My apologies to anyone who may have attempted to post a comment on any pages (for example, the [savsender](../projects/savsender.md) discussion page).
