Most things seem to be working now.  I think.

Comments appear to be disabled, but honestly, until I can deal with setting up recaptcha again, that's probably fine.

At some point I also need to go through and groom this dusty old place... I don't have a [MythTV](../projects/MythTV.md) box anymore.  I'm sure not using my telescope.  And a picture gallery is **sooooo** 2001.

Of course, the whole style of this place is a bit 2001, but I think I'm okay with a little retro[^1].

But there's definitely some weeding that needs to be done.

Sooooon...

[^1]: Okay, really retro... [The About Page](The_About_Page.md) actually refers to "the weblog craze". Holy wow...
