So, today, one of my "friends" at work was so kind as to post a Google code search, with my name as a search term, on our internal IRC server (thanks a lot, Jeremy... jerk!).  For those not aware, Google now has a specialized search engine that allows one to search through publically available source code (the bits that comprise the blueprint for a piece of software).  It's pretty handy for many things (computing various code metrics, finding interesting code snippets, and so forth).  But, as it happens, it's also a great way to find code authored by specific people.  And, in this case, that specific person was me.

Well, this got me thinking: Imagine you're applying for a job.  Further, suppose, in your younger, less experienced years, you made some of your work available online.  Perhaps you contributed to some open source project.  Or maybe you released something of your own.  Well, your potential employer now has a very easy way to find these bits and bobs, and may very well choose to include them as part of your evaluation.  Now, that's fine if all you've ever made available online is top-quality code.  But for hacks like me, this can be a problem.

Of course, since the advent of the search engine, an employer has always had the option of digging around on the Internet for information about prospective employees, which is why it's important to be careful about what you post online.  But, for those in the tech sector, Google code search means their past work can now be more easily tracked down and evaluated.

And in case you were curious, you can see what Google has to say about me [here](http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=brett+kosinski&hl=en&btnG=Search+Code).
