So the weather is looking pretty darn fine, right now, and tomorrow, in theory, it's supposed to be 24 and a mix of sun and cloud.  It seems like a great day to take off.  And yet... I'm torn.

You see, on a day like today (or perhaps tomorrow), my idea of a perfect afternoon is as follows:

1. Load up bike with book and blanket.
2. Cycle to grocery store and acquire supplies for sandwiches (ham and swiss preferred), along with fruit and beverage.
3. Go to local park, say Hermitage, find a nice tree, and bask.
4. Eat lunch.
5. Read.
6. Eventually go home.

That's basically it.  Quiet.  Peaceful.  A good book and some food.  This is a perfect day for me.

The trouble is the weather.  You see, a couple weeks ago I tried to execute this plan.  I took a Friday off in anticipation of good weather, and was quite excited to get out and enjoy it.  You can guess what actually happened.  Cloudy.  Dreary.  Warm, but not fantastic.  It was really quite a disappointment.

So the question is, do I tempt fate and try it again tomorrow?  I really don't know... I think I should, but I'm afraid of being disappointed again.  Stupid Mother Nature... so fickle...
