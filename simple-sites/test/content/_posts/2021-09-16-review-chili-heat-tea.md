> Smooth black tea that packs a punch of spicy heat.

Anyone who knows me knows I absolutely love wickedly spicy food.  I also happen to enjoy a nice black tea from time to time (though given the choice I prefer a fragrant, earthy oolong).  So I was very curious what this one would be like.

It turns out the answer is: quite good!

The black tea is very nice.  I'd describe it as a solid Assam-style black (and I wrote that before checking the label, so, well done Vintage Fork!)

But the question I'm sure everyone is asking is: how spicy was it?  I'd personally describe it as present but gentle, producing a nice warming without being too assertive.  Though I should caveat that by noting I tend to eat *very* spicy food, so my scale for heat might be a little... askew.  As was the case with the [Garlic Tea](2021-08-28-review-garlic-tea.md), I was genuinely surprised how well this pairing worked.

All in all, I really enjoyed this one, and unlike their Garlic Tea, I can see enjoying this at any time, even when I'm not eating a savoury meal.
