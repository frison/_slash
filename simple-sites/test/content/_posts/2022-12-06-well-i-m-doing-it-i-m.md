Well, I'm doing it. I'm taking a full three weeks off over Christmas: two weeks of staycation and then a ski trip first week of January. If I do it right that'll mean time to hack on jekyll-webmention_io, do a bit of writing, play with my Steam Deck until my thumbs stop working, and then ski until I fall down. It will be glorious!
