Well, I did it!  Granted, it took two attempts... the first loaf... well, let's just say it didn't go terribly well.  But the second one turned out very good!

Looks pretty nice, eh?  The crumb is a bit on the tight side, but the flavour is nicely sour, and the crust and crumb are chewy, which I kinda like, actually.  Should make some mighty fine sandwiches!
