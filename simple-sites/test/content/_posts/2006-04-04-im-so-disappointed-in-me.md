Wow.  So Lenore returned from Regina yesterday morning at around 5:00 am and opted to go straight into work, and so I decided to go in early, so we could bail out from work around 2:00 pm.  That evening we then proceeded to rent a few movies, two of which were 1-day's, so we had to watch them right away.

Well, the first movie was "Dreamer".  Think Seabiscuit, but with a little girl instead.  Or, put another way, a chick flick with a horse.  But, hey, it wasn't "She's the Man", so I can't really complain.  And it had Kris Kristofferson	... and, really, how can you go wrong with Kris Kristofferson?

The second movie was "Domino".  Now, I don't know if it was because it was late and I was tired (we started the movie at 10:00, and I'd been up for 16 hours by that point), but "Domino" must be one of the worst attempts at a stylized action movie I've seen in quite some time.  Plot?  Atrocious... so confusing, I don't think the writers knew what was going on.  The "style"?  Horribly distracting.  In retrospect, the reason I found the movie so confusing may have been from the epileptic seizures the visuals were triggering.  Frankly, I think the only purpose of this movie was to show how awesomely badass Keira Knightley could be.  The problem is, she was really not that awesome at all... in fact, she was pretty terrible.

But, in the end, I think the real question is this:  why didn't I just stop watching this movie?!?  I just kept watching and watching, even though the movie went from scene to scene delving deeper and deeper into realms of suck rarely visited, let alone depicted in film.  I could have made it all stop, but I didn't.  I let myself down.  And for that, I apologize to me.
