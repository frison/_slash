Oh thank the lord, it's done.  The [Dr. Who Scarf](Dr._Who_Scarf.md) is done!  And I even took a 
picture, just like I said I would:

It turned out pretty darn nice, if I do say so myself... a little wavy on the edges, but I blame the varying yarn weight.  I swear, it ain't my fault!  It was all the yarn.  Stupid yarn.

Anyway, now I'm on to my next project.  I figured I'd make a dent in my largish sock yarn collection by making <drum roll> a pair of socks!  Toe-up socks, no less!  You see, typically socks are made from the cuff down.  Unforunately, this has two disadvantages:

1. You have to sew the toe closed.  And for someone who sucks at Kitchener Stitch (like, say, me), this sucks.
2. It's not possible to try the sock on as you make it.

Making socks toe-up solves this problem.  It's also cool.  Or so I tell myself.    Anyway, here's a picture of the current work-in-progress:

Amusingly enough, I have a sneaking suspicion it's a bit big.
