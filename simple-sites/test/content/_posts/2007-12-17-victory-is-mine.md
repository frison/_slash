Well, I won the battle, anyway, even if the war is still ongoing.  Word wrapping appears to work, menu items wrap, larger font sizes are now fully supported.  And it looks mighty fine!  And so, [NetHackDS](../projects/NetHackDS.md) version 1.10 is now available!

Of course, now I have to move on to the myriad other features on the list.
