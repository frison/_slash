It was a beautiful friday afternoon as we stepped out of the office tower, a hot breeze wafting to our noses the scent of trees laden with brilliant white and pink flowers, their pedals littering the ground below.  Overhead, a bright, blue-grey sky was pocked with puffs of white clouds, the seeds of the thunderheads which would loom dark in the eastern sky that evening.

Stepping into the sunlight, we passed a line of dark red mailboxes standing like sentinels against a wall of rough, pink granite.  As we rounded the corner, I looked up to see the sign for Scotia place, the red text advertising the various services provided therein:

Now that's what I call service!
