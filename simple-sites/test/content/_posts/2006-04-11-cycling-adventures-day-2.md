So I thought yesterday was pretty interesting, as far as cycling goes, but I **think** today's adventure is even better.  As part of my ride to work, I take a bike path that extends from 111th ave to 104th, sandwiched between a commercial and residential area.  Well, as I was pedaling along, approaching 107th ave, I noticed a dark something on the path, which slowly resolved into what appeared to be an abandoned bike.  But, as I got closer, I realized, this bike wasn't abandoned after all:  it's accompanied by it's owner, who is unconscious, laying face down on the pavement beside it.

Now, my first thought was, this dude got into an accident and was knocked unconscious.  So I checked to make sure he was breathing (just observed his back rising and falling), and called at him to see if he would respond.  Nothing.  Nudged him a bit.  Nothing.  Nudged a bit more.  Still nothing.  At this point, I figured he was probably just passed out, but if he passed out on his bike, he might have suffered a head injury, thus it was probably best to call an ambulance, so I pedaled down to The Brick, which was just 50 meters away or so, and they called 911, who dispatched emergency services to come check him out.  Meanwhile, they asked me to wait around until the EMS folks showed up.

The EMS guys arrived just a couple minutes later (they were remarkably fast, IMHO), and proceeded to attempt to wake the guy up.  Last I saw, he was slowly coming to, though he was only half conscious at best.

So that's cycling day 2.  What will be in store for day 3?  It's anyone's guess!
