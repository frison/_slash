The sequel has arrived.  We were passing by a Future Shop downtown, and we decided to stop in, and lo and behold, they got in new stock!  So I decided to take the plunge once more.  I hope I don't live to regret this.

OTOH, this time I bought the extended warrantee.  Of course, normally, these things are scams, and primarily act as just a great way to pump up the sales dude's commission.  But, in this case, particularly given my first experience, it seemed worth the money.  Of course, if I decide enough is enough, I just threw $60 out the window.  Then again, if things go south in 6 months, it'll all be worth it (the warrantee is for a rather ample 2 years).

'course, the real irony in all this is that, just today, I discovered [PocketMod](http://www.pocketmod.com).  It's been raved about again and again elsewhere, so I won't get too deep into it, but it basically lets you make small, customizable 8-page booklets, which can contain anything from calendars to to-do lists to music staffs, and are intended to act as little organizers/notebooks/what-have-you.  Which, of course, is exactly what my Palm is for. :)  Oh well, a PocketMod or two is still useful for other things, and I'll put my more 'mission critical' stuff on paper, rather than dedicating the information solely to my Palm (eg, important contact information, etc).
