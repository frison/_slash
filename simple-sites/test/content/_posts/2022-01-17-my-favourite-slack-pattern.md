My favourite Slack anti-pattern:  
&#8203;  
Person:  Hey, do you have a minute for a quick call?  
Me:  Sure!  
[15 minutes goes by]  
Me:  Okay, well, I need to go do something else now, but I'll be available in 20 minutes.  
Person: [attempts to call immediately]  
[20 minutes goes by]  
Me:  Alright, I'm free again.  
[10 minutes goes by]  
Person:  Too late, I'm busy.  
Me:  😑😐😡
